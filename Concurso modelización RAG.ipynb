    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements a question-answering (Q&A) system over a technical research paper from Meta SuperIntelligence Labs. The goal is to compare how different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setups help a large language model (LLM) answer multiple-choice questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following retrieval pipelines are compared:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM Baseline** – Direct generation without retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BM25** – Classic sparse keyword search (TF-IDF based).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dense Retrieval** – Embedding-based semantic retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(Bonus) Hybrid Retrieval** – Combination of BM25 and Dense Retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(Bonus) Hybrid Retrieval + Cross-Encoder** – A SOTA approach where a high-recall retriever fetches candidates (Hybrid, k=20) and a Cross-Encoder reranks them for high precision (k=5).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure robustness, reproducibility, and scientific rigor, this project integrates several software engineering patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Singleton Pattern for Retrieval Engine:** The `RetrievalEngine` class uses a Singleton pattern with **Lazy Loading**. This prevents memory overhead by loading heavy models only when necessary and ensures consistent database connections across the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Smart Ingestion Strategy:** We compare **Recursive Chunking** (optimized with high overlap to preserve scientific context) against **Semantic Chunking** (experimental), which uses embedding distances to segment text by topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automated \"Judge\" Evaluation:** Instead of relying solely on the final answer accuracy, we implement a **Ground Truth Verification** system. It compares the retrieved chunks against the source reference in the dataset to detect lucky guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two-Stage Architecture:** A funnel approach that prioritizes *Recall* in the first stage (Hybrid Search) and *Precision* in the second stage (Cross-Encoder Re-ranking)."

    "## Data Ingestions and Chunking Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial stage of the RAG pipeline focuses on **Data Pre-processing**. This involves breaking down the source document (`paper_refrag.pdf`) into discrete units of knowledge (**chunks**) that are stored in **ChromaDB**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chunking Methodologies\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented two primary chunking strategies, selectable via the `CHUNKING_METHOD` variable in `src/ingestion.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Recursive Chunking (Recursive Character Splitter):** This is the baseline method, optimized for technical context. It relies on rules of fixed length (e.g., **1200 characters** with **350 characters of overlap**).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Semantic Chunking:** The advanced method. It utilizes an **embedding model** to compute the similarity between consecutive sentences, identifying natural **topic shifts** to define chunk boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Semantic Chunking?\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to focus on **Semantic Chunking** because it addresses the primary weakness of RAG in technical domains: **avoiding false negatives** in retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "In dense scientific papers, naive splitting often cuts conclusions, cross-references, or complex sentences in half. This leads to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Loss of Context:** The embedding model creates an inaccurate vector because the sentence is fragmented.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lucky guesses:** The system answers correctly, but the strict evaluation judge fails to find the complete reference phrase because it was broken up.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using **Semantic Chunking**, we ensure that each unit of information passed to the retriever has the **highest possible semantic coherence**, which directly improves the **Retrieval Recall** and **Fidelity** metrics in our evaluation dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the text is chunked, the system proceeds to **initialize the Retriever** in a **Lazy Loading** state, ensuring the database connection is established efficiently right before the first query is made."
