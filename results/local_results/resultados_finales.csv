However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)).

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration.

(2024) to use the next paragraph prediction\ntasks for continual pre-training (CPT). Specifically, for each data data point, it containss + o = T number\nof tokens, which we use for CPT to prepare the model for downstream tasks utilizing chunk embeddings. To further enhance performance, we introduce selective compression via RL. After aligning the encoder and\ndecoder through CPT, we apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt the model to specific downstream\ntasks, such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Additional details are provided in section 5. During CPT, we input the firsts tokens x1:s into the encoder and use its output to assist the decoder in\npredicting the nexto tokens xs+1:s+o. This task encourages the model to leverage contextual information for\nnext-paragraph prediction, thereby equipping it for downstream applications. The objective is to align any\nencoder–decoder combination so that the generations produced withcompressed contextclosely resemble\nthose generated by the original decoder with access to the full context. 3.1 Continual Pre-training Recipe\nTo ensure the success of the CPT phase, we propose a training recipe that incorporates a reconstruction task\nand a curriculum learning approach. Ablation studies in section 4 demonstrate thatthis recipeiscrucialfor\nachieving strong CPT performance. Reconstruction task.We input the firsts tokens x1:s to the encoder and learn to reconstruct tokensx1:s in\nthe decoder.'), Document(metadata={'page': 9, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='(2024)\nand Lin et al. (2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

Date:October 14, 2025\nCorrespondence:Aritra Ghosh atarighosh@meta.com\nCode:Will be available athttps://github.com/facebookresearch/refrag\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in contextual learning, leveraging\ninformation from their input to achieve superior performance across a range of downstream applications. For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 9, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='(2024)\nand Lin et al. (2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)).

For reference,LLaMA256 uses only the last 256 tokens, matching the number of chunk\nembeddings inREFRAG8 (s/k = 256), yetREFRAG8 consistently surpassesLLaMA256, demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of compressed chunk embeddings.

The perplexity-based selection is an heuristic based selection which compresses\nchunks with low perplexity (Perplexity-desc) or high perplexity (Perplexity-asc).

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 23, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='Table 15 shows the performance ofREFRAGunder different number of context for\nstrong retriever setting.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)). When given a questionx1, .'), Document(metadata={'page': 9, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='(2024)\nand Lin et al. (2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements. Complementary approaches\nrank or prune context by estimated informativeness, e.g.,Selective Contextuses self-information to drop\nlow-value tokens, and sentence-level methods learn context-aware encoders for question-specific compression\nand faster inference Li et al.

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks. The policy network leverages\nchunk embeddings and masking to optimize sequential chunk expansion, thereby preserving the decoder’s\nautoregressive property and enabling flexible placement of compression.

Our model outperformsLLaMAFT on two out of three datasets in the 5-passage setting, and on all three\ndatasets in the 10-passage setting. This improvement is attributable to the limited 4k-token context window of\nLLaMAFT, which necessitates truncating portions of the conversational history in longer contexts, resulting\nin the loss of crucial information required to answer subsequent questions. In contrast, our model, trained on\nthe sameLLaMA model without extending its effective positional encoding, maintains robust performance\n3Note that the implementation of our exact match is stricter than other works. We follow the work of Lin et al.'), Document(metadata={'page': 1, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='ranging from modifying the attention mechanism’s complexity (Beltagy et al., 2020) to sparsifying attention\nand context (Child et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024), and altering context feeding strategies (Yen\net al., 2024). However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks. The policy network leverages\nchunk embeddings and masking to optimize sequential chunk expansion, thereby preserving the decoder’s\nautoregressive property and enabling flexible placement of compression.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time.

A.1 Modeling REFRAG Selective Compression\nIn this section, we introduce selective token compression, based on the hypothesis that different context\nsegments contribute unequally to answer prediction. Less critical segments are compressed, while essential\nones remain intact, as illustrated in figure 5. We employ RL to train a policy that optimally determines which\nsegments to compress. To enable selective compression, we continue pretraining the encoder and decoder to process a combination\nof token and chunk embeddings.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 22, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='103 104\n# Input T okens\n0\n20\n40\n60\nAcceleration\nTTFT Acceleration\n103 104\n# Input T okens\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nAcceleration\nTTIT Acceleration\n103 104\n# Input T okens\n2\n4\n6Acceleration\nThroughput Acceleration\nREFRAG (Cached) REFRAG (Not Cached) CEPE\nFigure 8Empirical verification of inference acceleration ofREFRAGwithk= 32. 103 104\n# Input T okens\n0\n5\n10\n15\nAcceleration\nTTFT Acceleration\n103 104\n# Input T okens\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nAcceleration\nTTIT Acceleration\n103 104\n# Input T okens\n2\n4\n6Acceleration\nThroughput Acceleration\nREFRAG (Cached) REFRAG (Not Cached) CEPE\nFigure 9Empirical verification of inference acceleration ofREFRAGwithk= 8.

REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1).

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements. Complementary approaches\nrank or prune context by estimated informativeness, e.g.,Selective Contextuses self-information to drop\nlow-value tokens, and sentence-level methods learn context-aware encoders for question-specific compression\nand faster inference Li et al.

Notably,REFRAG8 and REFRAG16\nconsistently outperform other baselines across nearly all settings, while also achieving lower latency than\nCEPE (figure 2). For reference,LLaMA256 uses only the last 256 tokens, matching the number of chunk\nembeddings inREFRAG8 (s/k = 256), yetREFRAG8 consistently surpassesLLaMA256, demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of compressed chunk embeddings.

The perplexity-based selection is an heuristic based selection which compresses\nchunks with low perplexity (Perplexity-desc) or high perplexity (Perplexity-asc).

The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time.

The result demonstrates that\nunder the same number of retrieved passages, we are able to match the performance of LLaMA in the strong\nretriever setting and even outperform LLaMA under the weak retriever setting. This is because our model\nenables larger context and hence enables extract more useful information when the retrieved passages are less\nrelevant. Under equivalent latency constraints,REFRAGconsistently outperform LLaMA on both settings\nas the saved context can be reinvested to include additional information within the same latency budget. Figure 4 compares the performance ofREFRAGand the LLaMA model under two conditions: 1) an equal\nnumber of retrieved passages, and 2) equal latency, for both strong and weak retriever settings.With a strong\nretriever and a maximum of 10 passages,REFRAGmatches LLaMA’s performance while achieving a5.26×\nspeedup in TTFT. At equal latency (8 passages forREFRAGvs. 1 for LLaMA),REFRAGattains a1.22%\naverage improvement across 16 RAG tasks. With a weak retriever setting, at 10 passages,REFRAGimproves\nperformance by0.71%and accelerates TTFT by5.26× compared to LLaMA. At equal latency (8 passages for\nREFRAGvs. 1 for LLaMA),REFRAGachieves a1.93%average gain over 16 RAG tasks. 5.2 Multi-Turn Conversation\nWe use three different knowledge-intensive multi-turn conversation datasets: TopiOCQA (Adlakha et al.,\n2022), ORConvQA (Qu et al., 2020), and QReCC (Anantha et al., 2021). For each conversation turn, we\nretrieveKpassages using the same retriever and retrieval corpus as described in section 5.1. Result analysis.Table 4 presents results across varying numbers of conversational turns and retrieved passages. Our model outperformsLLaMAFT on two out of three datasets in the 5-passage setting, and on all three\ndatasets in the 10-passage setting. This improvement is attributable to the limited 4k-token context window of\nLLaMAFT, which necessitates truncating portions of the conversational history in longer contexts, resulting\nin the loss of crucial information required to answer subsequent questions. In contrast, our model, trained on\nthe sameLLaMA model without extending its effective positional encoding, maintains robust performance\n3Note that the implementation of our exact match is stricter than other works.

We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 23, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='Table 15 shows the performance ofREFRAGunder different number of context for\nstrong retriever setting.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.
