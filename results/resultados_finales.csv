We employ RL to train a policy that optimally determines which\nsegments to compress.\nTo enable selective compression, we continue pretraining the encoder and decoder to process a combination\nof token and chunk embeddings. Given a context ofs tokens x1, . . . , xs, chunked intoL fixed-length chunks\nC1, . . . , CL, we achieve a compression fraction of1−p by randomly selectingT′ := pL chunks to remain\nuncompressed for the decoder. This pretraining allows the model to effectively handle mixed inputs at\narbitrary positions, which is essential for the subsequent RL policy learning.'), Document(metadata={'page': 4, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='policy under differentp.

Less critical segments are compressed, while essential\nones remain intact, as illustrated in figure 5. We employ RL to train a policy that optimally determines which\nsegments to compress.\nTo enable selective compression, we continue pretraining the encoder and decoder to process a combination\nof token and chunk embeddings. Given a context ofs tokens x1, . . . , xs, chunked intoL fixed-length chunks\nC1, . . . , CL, we achieve a compression fraction of1−p by randomly selectingT′ := pL chunks to remain\nuncompressed for the decoder.

Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder.\nCurriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex.
