REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)).

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025')]"

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025')]"

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)). When given a questionx1, .'), Document(metadata={'page': 9, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='(2024)\nand Lin et al. (2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks. The policy network leverages\nchunk embeddings and masking to optimize sequential chunk expansion, thereby preserving the decoder’s\nautoregressive property and enabling flexible placement of compression.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024).

Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to.

A.1 Modeling REFRAG Selective Compression\nIn this section, we introduce selective token compression, based on the hypothesis that different context\nsegments contribute unequally to answer prediction. Less critical segments are compressed, while essential\nones remain intact, as illustrated in figure 5. We employ RL to train a policy that optimally determines which\nsegments to compress. To enable selective compression, we continue pretraining the encoder and decoder to process a combination\nof token and chunk embeddings.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG).

Date:October 14, 2025\nCorrespondence:Aritra Ghosh atarighosh@meta.com\nCode:Will be available athttps://github.com/facebookresearch/refrag\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in contextual learning, leveraging\ninformation from their input to achieve superior performance across a range of downstream applications. For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 22, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='103 104\n# Input T okens\n0\n20\n40\n60\nAcceleration\nTTFT Acceleration\n103 104\n# Input T okens\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nAcceleration\nTTIT Acceleration\n103 104\n# Input T okens\n2\n4\n6Acceleration\nThroughput Acceleration\nREFRAG (Cached) REFRAG (Not Cached) CEPE\nFigure 8Empirical verification of inference acceleration ofREFRAGwithk= 32. 103 104\n# Input T okens\n0\n5\n10\n15\nAcceleration\nTTFT Acceleration\n103 104\n# Input T okens\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nAcceleration\nTTIT Acceleration\n103 104\n# Input T okens\n2\n4\n6Acceleration\nThroughput Acceleration\nREFRAG (Cached) REFRAG (Not Cached) CEPE\nFigure 9Empirical verification of inference acceleration ofREFRAGwithk= 8.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

The flop rate of the GPU is\nf, and the high bandwidth memory of the GPU ism and we use the compression rate ofk in our encoder. We assume that all our chunk embeddings are precomputed and cached. The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time.

To enable selective compression, we continue pretraining the encoder and decoder to process a combination\nof token and chunk embeddings. Given a context ofs tokens x1, . .'), Document(metadata={'page': 7, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='Our model has even higher performance gains in multi-choice\ntasks.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work.

We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)).

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)). When given a questionx1, .'), Document(metadata={'page': 9, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='(2024)\nand Lin et al. (2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements. Complementary approaches\nrank or prune context by estimated informativeness, e.g.,Selective Contextuses self-information to drop\nlow-value tokens, and sentence-level methods learn context-aware encoders for question-specific compression\nand faster inference Li et al.

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements. Complementary approaches\nrank or prune context by estimated informativeness, e.g.,Selective Contextuses self-information to drop\nlow-value tokens, and sentence-level methods learn context-aware encoders for question-specific compression\nand faster inference Li et al.

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025')]"

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc.

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query.

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 22, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='Additional results in RAG.Table 16 shows the performance of different baselines under the same number of\ncontext.

Figure 4 compares the performance ofREFRAGand the LLaMA model under two conditions: 1) an equal\nnumber of retrieved passages, and 2) equal latency, for both strong and weak retriever settings.With a strong\nretriever and a maximum of 10 passages,REFRAGmatches LLaMA’s performance while achieving a5.26×\nspeedup in TTFT.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG).

Date:October 14, 2025\nCorrespondence:Aritra Ghosh atarighosh@meta.com\nCode:Will be available athttps://github.com/facebookresearch/refrag\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in contextual learning, leveraging\ninformation from their input to achieve superior performance across a range of downstream applications. For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 23, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='Table 15 shows the performance ofREFRAGunder different number of context for\nstrong retriever setting.

The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks. The policy network leverages\nchunk embeddings and masking to optimize sequential chunk expansion, thereby preserving the decoder’s\nautoregressive property and enabling flexible placement of compression. Further discussion on sequential\nselection is provided in section A.1.'), Document(metadata={'page': 18, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='parameters in the model, including the decoder parameters.

For the\nprojection layer, we use a 2-layer multi-layer perception (MLP) with an hidden size that is equivalent to the\noutput size (i.e.,4096for LLaMA-2-7B).

This finding is particularly surprising, asREFRAG16 achieves a compression rate of8without recomputing\nchunk embeddings, yet still surpasses the performance ofREFRAG8. These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance. REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1). In contrast, a compression rate of64appears to be overly aggressive, resulting in\ndiminished performance. These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced.

Figure 11 presents results for various encoder-decoder\ncombinations.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)).

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)). When given a questionx1, .'), Document(metadata={'page': 3, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='In this task, wefreeze the decoder model and only train the encoder and projection layer. The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks. The policy network leverages\nchunk embeddings and masking to optimize sequential chunk expansion, thereby preserving the decoder’s\nautoregressive property and enabling flexible placement of compression.

Additionally, an RL policy is trained to do selective compression to further improve\nthe performance which we will defer the discussion to section 2.

Theoretical analysis (section A) shows that for short context lengths, our method achieves up to\nk× acceleration in TTFT and throughput. For longer context length, acceleration reaches up tok2× for both\nmetrics.

We achieve up to6.78× throughput acceleration compared to LLaMA, significantly\noutperforming CEPE.

The flop rate of the GPU is\nf, and the high bandwidth memory of the GPU ism and we use the compression rate ofk in our encoder. We assume that all our chunk embeddings are precomputed and cached. The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time. Overall we achieve upto6.78× and\n6.06×acceleration in throughput much higher than CEPE in the long context scenario.

The flop rate of the GPU is\nf, and the high bandwidth memory of the GPU ism and we use the compression rate ofk in our encoder. We assume that all our chunk embeddings are precomputed and cached. The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time.

Less critical segments are compressed, while essential\nones remain intact, as illustrated in figure 5. We employ RL to train a policy that optimally determines which\nsegments to compress. To enable selective compression, we continue pretraining the encoder and decoder to process a combination\nof token and chunk embeddings.

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query.

The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024).

Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time.

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages\noften exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to\nblock-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based\non this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are\nunnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose\nREFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency\nin RAG applications. By exploiting this attention sparsity structure, we demonstrate a30.85× the\ntime-to-first-token acceleration (3.75× improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity.'), Document(metadata={'page': 1, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='ranging from modifying the attention mechanism’s complexity (Beltagy et al., 2020) to sparsifying attention\nand context (Child et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024), and altering context feeding strategies (Yen\net al., 2024). However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)). When given a questionx1, .'), Document(metadata={'page': 9, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='(2024)\nand Lin et al. (2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4.

With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time.

Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization.

This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages\noften exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to\nblock-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based\non this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are\nunnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose\nREFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency\nin RAG applications.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method.

This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al.

CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al.

Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al.

Given a context ofs tokens x1, . .'), Document(metadata={'page': 3, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='In this task, wefreeze the decoder model and only train the encoder and projection layer. The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction.

This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al.

CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al.

Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)).

The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 6, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='This observation aligns with previous findings by Li et al.

Date:October 14, 2025\nCorrespondence:Aritra Ghosh atarighosh@meta.com\nCode:Will be available athttps://github.com/facebookresearch/refrag\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in contextual learning, leveraging\ninformation from their input to achieve superior performance across a range of downstream applications. For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 6, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='0 100 101 102\nNumber of Passages\n50\n52\n54\n56\nPerformance\nPerformance vs. Retrieved Passages\n0 100 101 102 103\nInput Length (Latency)\n50\n52\n54\n56\nPerformance\nPerformance vs. Latency\nLlama REFRAG 8 ×  compression\n0 100 101 102\nNumber of Passages\n52\n54\nPerformance\nPerformance vs. Retrieved Passages\n0 100 101 102 103\nInput Length (Latency)\n52\n54\nPerformance\nPerformance vs. Latency\nLlama REFRAG 8 ×  compression\nFigure 4RAG performance comparison under a strong retriever scenario (left) and a weak retriever scenario and a\nstrong retriever scenario (right).REFRAGperform similarly to LLaMA model under the same retrieved passages\n(slightly better in a weaker retriever case) while outperform significantly under the same latency.

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025')]"

The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)).

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements. Complementary approaches\nrank or prune context by estimated informativeness, e.g.,Selective Contextuses self-information to drop\nlow-value tokens, and sentence-level methods learn context-aware encoders for question-specific compression\nand faster inference Li et al.

The decoder’s auto-\nregressive property is maintained, and compression can be applied at any position within the input, not just\nat the beginning. Within our selective compression framework, the objective is to chooseT′ chunks fromL\ntotal chunks to maximize a specified reward. Formally, this can be expressed as the following combinatorial\noptimization problem:\nGiven[L] :={1,2, . . . , L},\nmax\nl⊆[L]\nr(x, l)\ns.t.|l|=T ′\nThis problem is non-differentiable due to its discrete nature, and exact solutions are NP-hard.

These studies show that such greedy\nformulations enable the use of RL to achieve near-optimal solutions and generalize well across diverse settings.

The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills.

Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings).

REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

This arrangement is input to the decoderMdec to predictxs+1:s+o. The decoder’s auto-\nregressive property is maintained, and compression can be applied at any position within the input, not just\nat the beginning. Within our selective compression framework, the objective is to chooseT′ chunks fromL\ntotal chunks to maximize a specified reward. Formally, this can be expressed as the following combinatorial\noptimization problem:\nGiven[L] :={1,2, . . . , L},\nmax\nl⊆[L]\nr(x, l)\ns.t.|l|=T ′\nThis problem is non-differentiable due to its discrete nature, and exact solutions are NP-hard. Consequently,\nprior work has proposed greedy approaches that incrementally construct solutions by modeling the task as a\nsequential decision-making problem (Dai et al., 2017; Bello et al., 2017). These studies show that such greedy\nformulations enable the use of RL to achieve near-optimal solutions and generalize well across diverse settings. Motivated by these findings, we adopt a sequential formulation for selective compression and employ RL to\ntrain an effective policy (see section 2).

This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)). When given a questionx1, .'), Document(metadata={'page': 16, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='(uncompressed). This arrangement is input to the decoderMdec to predictxs+1:s+o. The decoder’s auto-\nregressive property is maintained, and compression can be applied at any position within the input, not just\nat the beginning. Within our selective compression framework, the objective is to chooseT′ chunks fromL\ntotal chunks to maximize a specified reward. Formally, this can be expressed as the following combinatorial\noptimization problem:\nGiven[L] :={1,2, . . . , L},\nmax\nl⊆[L]\nr(x, l)\ns.t.|l|=T ′\nThis problem is non-differentiable due to its discrete nature, and exact solutions are NP-hard. Consequently,\nprior work has proposed greedy approaches that incrementally construct solutions by modeling the task as a\nsequential decision-making problem (Dai et al., 2017; Bello et al., 2017). These studies show that such greedy\nformulations enable the use of RL to achieve near-optimal solutions and generalize well across diverse settings. Motivated by these findings, we adopt a sequential formulation for selective compression and employ RL to\ntrain an effective policy (see section 2). We learn a policy networkπθ that takes chunk embeddings{ci}L\ni=1 and sequentially selectsT′ chunk indices\nl1, . .'), Document(metadata={'page': 4, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='Bolded results compare baselines, excludingLLaMA-Full Contextand LLaMA-32K, which use full\ncontext without compression and are expected to perform best. Notably,REFRAG8 and REFRAG16\nconsistently outperform other baselines across nearly all settings, while also achieving lower latency than\nCEPE (figure 2). For reference,LLaMA256 uses only the last 256 tokens, matching the number of chunk\nembeddings inREFRAG8 (s/k = 256), yetREFRAG8 consistently surpassesLLaMA256, demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of compressed chunk embeddings.

The original Llama-2-7B supports only a4k context window, whereas our approach enables extrapolation via\nchunk embeddings, extending context and supporting broader applications. With a compression rate of16, we achieve a9.3%average log-perplexity improvement over CEPE across\nfour datasets2. Meanwhile, our method is16.53× faster than LLaMA in TTFT and2.01× faster than CEPE\n(section B.4). At a compression rate of32, our log-perplexity matches CEPE, while TTFT acceleration\nincreases to30.85×over LLaMA and3.75×over CEPE. Figure 3 presents the performance of various methods for selective compression. We expandp fraction of the\nchunks in the original token space using the RL policy. The effective compression ratek\n1−p+kp decreases when\nfewer chunks are compressed (i.e.,p increases). We compare the perplexity ofxs+1:s+o using different selection\npolicy under differentp. The perplexity-based selection is an heuristic based selection which compresses\nchunks with low perplexity (Perplexity-desc) or high perplexity (Perplexity-asc). The perplexity is measured\nby the LLaMA-2-7B model. Intuitively, a chunk with lower perplexity contains less information and can\ntherefore be compressed with minimal information loss.

(2024) to use the next paragraph prediction\ntasks for continual pre-training (CPT). Specifically, for each data data point, it containss + o = T number\nof tokens, which we use for CPT to prepare the model for downstream tasks utilizing chunk embeddings. To further enhance performance, we introduce selective compression via RL. After aligning the encoder and\ndecoder through CPT, we apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt the model to specific downstream\ntasks, such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Additional details are provided in section 5. During CPT, we input the firsts tokens x1:s into the encoder and use its output to assist the decoder in\npredicting the nexto tokens xs+1:s+o. This task encourages the model to leverage contextual information for\nnext-paragraph prediction, thereby equipping it for downstream applications. The objective is to align any\nencoder–decoder combination so that the generations produced withcompressed contextclosely resemble\nthose generated by the original decoder with access to the full context. 3.1 Continual Pre-training Recipe\nTo ensure the success of the CPT phase, we propose a training recipe that incorporates a reconstruction task\nand a curriculum learning approach. Ablation studies in section 4 demonstrate thatthis recipeiscrucialfor\nachieving strong CPT performance.

The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks. The policy network leverages\nchunk embeddings and masking to optimize sequential chunk expansion, thereby preserving the decoder’s\nautoregressive property and enabling flexible placement of compression. Further discussion on sequential\nselection is provided in section A.1.'), Document(metadata={'page': 9, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='(2024)\nand Lin et al. (2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements. Complementary approaches\nrank or prune context by estimated informativeness, e.g.,Selective Contextuses self-information to drop\nlow-value tokens, and sentence-level methods learn context-aware encoders for question-specific compression\nand faster inference Li et al.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

To further enhance performance, we introduce selective compression via RL. After aligning the encoder and\ndecoder through CPT, we apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt the model to specific downstream\ntasks, such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Additional details are provided in section 5. During CPT, we input the firsts tokens x1:s into the encoder and use its output to assist the decoder in\npredicting the nexto tokens xs+1:s+o.

Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks. The policy network leverages\nchunk embeddings and masking to optimize sequential chunk expansion, thereby preserving the decoder’s\nautoregressive property and enabling flexible placement of compression. Further discussion on sequential\nselection is provided in section A.1.'), Document(metadata={'page': 3, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='on empirical evaluation is in section A. 3 Methodology\nTo align the encoder and decoder, we follow the work of Yen et al. (2024) to use the next paragraph prediction\ntasks for continual pre-training (CPT). Specifically, for each data data point, it containss + o = T number\nof tokens, which we use for CPT to prepare the model for downstream tasks utilizing chunk embeddings. To further enhance performance, we introduce selective compression via RL. After aligning the encoder and\ndecoder through CPT, we apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt the model to specific downstream\ntasks, such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Additional details are provided in section 5. During CPT, we input the firsts tokens x1:s into the encoder and use its output to assist the decoder in\npredicting the nexto tokens xs+1:s+o. This task encourages the model to leverage contextual information for\nnext-paragraph prediction, thereby equipping it for downstream applications. The objective is to align any\nencoder–decoder combination so that the generations produced withcompressed contextclosely resemble\nthose generated by the original decoder with access to the full context. 3.1 Continual Pre-training Recipe\nTo ensure the success of the CPT phase, we propose a training recipe that incorporates a reconstruction task\nand a curriculum learning approach. Ablation studies in section 4 demonstrate thatthis recipeiscrucialfor\nachieving strong CPT performance.

For the\nprojection layer, we use a 2-layer multi-layer perception (MLP) with an hidden size that is equivalent to the\noutput size (i.e.,4096for LLaMA-2-7B). For both tasks we train our model for 4 epochs on the dataset using\nthe curriculum learning schedule (see figure 6). Computational Resources.We train all our models in Bfloat16 precision.

We observe that increasing the number of parameters in the decoder leads to a substantial\nreduction in loss, whereas enlarging the encoder yields only a modest improvement. This discrepancy may\nbe attributed to the relatively minor increase in size from RoBERTa-Base to RoBERTa-Large compared to\nthe substantial jump from 7B to 13B in the decoder.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)).

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages\noften exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to\nblock-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based\non this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are\nunnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose\nREFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency\nin RAG applications. By exploiting this attention sparsity structure, we demonstrate a30.85× the\ntime-to-first-token acceleration (3.75× improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity.'), Document(metadata={'page': 9, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='(2024)\nand Lin et al. (2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc.

Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 7, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='Our model has even higher performance gains in multi-choice\ntasks.

Additionally, an RL policy is trained to do selective compression to further improve\nthe performance which we will defer the discussion to section 2.

Our model outperformsLLaMAFT on two out of three datasets in the 5-passage setting, and on all three\ndatasets in the 10-passage setting. This improvement is attributable to the limited 4k-token context window of\nLLaMAFT, which necessitates truncating portions of the conversational history in longer contexts, resulting\nin the loss of crucial information required to answer subsequent questions.

We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1).

Our model outperformsLLaMAFT on two out of three datasets in the 5-passage setting, and on all three\ndatasets in the 10-passage setting. This improvement is attributable to the limited 4k-token context window of\nLLaMAFT, which necessitates truncating portions of the conversational history in longer contexts, resulting\nin the loss of crucial information required to answer subsequent questions. In contrast, our model, trained on\nthe sameLLaMA model without extending its effective positional encoding, maintains robust performance\n3Note that the implementation of our exact match is stricter than other works.

This finding is particularly surprising, asREFRAG16 achieves a compression rate of8without recomputing\nchunk embeddings, yet still surpasses the performance ofREFRAG8. These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance. REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1). In contrast, a compression rate of64appears to be overly aggressive, resulting in\ndiminished performance. These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced.

Figure 11 presents results for various encoder-decoder\ncombinations. We observe that increasing the number of parameters in the decoder leads to a substantial\nreduction in loss, whereas enlarging the encoder yields only a modest improvement. This discrepancy may\nbe attributed to the relatively minor increase in size from RoBERTa-Base to RoBERTa-Large compared to\nthe substantial jump from 7B to 13B in the decoder.

This dataset\ncontains long scientific articles from Arxiv and Pubmed, and the task is to generate the abstract given the\nentire article. This application is challenging due to the long-context nature of the task. We fine-tune the\nREFRAGandLLaMAmodels on these two datasets and report the performance on the validation set. The\nsummarization task provides an ideal condition to inspect whether it is beneficial to bring more information\nwith compressed representation or less information without compression, since correct summarization requires\ncomplete information from the whole document. Result analysis.Table 21 shows the performance of different baselines under the same number of tokens in the\ndecoder. REPLUGFT means that we adopt theREPLUG framework usingLLaMAFT, andREPLUGChat\nmeans that we adopt the LLaMA-2-7B-Chat model forREPLUG. We did not report some of our methods for\ncertain decoder token counts since there were not enough input tokens for those compression rates. Our model\nachieves the best performance under the same number of decoder tokens (i.e., same latency). Additionally,\nREFRAG16 performs better thanREFRAG8 at a decoder token count of 128, since the former model is\nable to incorporate more information from the document with a higher compression rate. 24')]"

The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks. The policy network leverages\nchunk embeddings and masking to optimize sequential chunk expansion, thereby preserving the decoder’s\nautoregressive property and enabling flexible placement of compression.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8.

Date:October 14, 2025\nCorrespondence:Aritra Ghosh atarighosh@meta.com\nCode:Will be available athttps://github.com/facebookresearch/refrag\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in contextual learning, leveraging\ninformation from their input to achieve superior performance across a range of downstream applications. For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 4, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='Bolded results compare baselines, excludingLLaMA-Full Contextand LLaMA-32K, which use full\ncontext without compression and are expected to perform best. Notably,REFRAG8 and REFRAG16\nconsistently outperform other baselines across nearly all settings, while also achieving lower latency than\nCEPE (figure 2). For reference,LLaMA256 uses only the last 256 tokens, matching the number of chunk\nembeddings inREFRAG8 (s/k = 256), yetREFRAG8 consistently surpassesLLaMA256, demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of compressed chunk embeddings.

Figure 3 presents the performance of various methods for selective compression. We expandp fraction of the\nchunks in the original token space using the RL policy. The effective compression ratek\n1−p+kp decreases when\nfewer chunks are compressed (i.e.,p increases). We compare the perplexity ofxs+1:s+o using different selection\npolicy under differentp. The perplexity-based selection is an heuristic based selection which compresses\nchunks with low perplexity (Perplexity-desc) or high perplexity (Perplexity-asc). The perplexity is measured\nby the LLaMA-2-7B model. Intuitively, a chunk with lower perplexity contains less information and can\ntherefore be compressed with minimal information loss.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements. Complementary approaches\nrank or prune context by estimated informativeness, e.g.,Selective Contextuses self-information to drop\nlow-value tokens, and sentence-level methods learn context-aware encoders for question-specific compression\nand faster inference Li et al.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8.

This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation.

With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time.

This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al.

StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al.

Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al.

However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability.

Theoretical analysis (section A) shows that for short context lengths, our method achieves up to\nk× acceleration in TTFT and throughput. For longer context length, acceleration reaches up tok2× for both\nmetrics. Empirically, as shown in figure 2, with a context length of16384(mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nwith k = 16achieves16 .53× TTFT acceleration with cache and8.59× without cache1, both surpassing CEPE\n(2.01× and1 .04×, respectively), while achieving 9.3% performance (measured by log-perplexity) compared\nto CEPE (table 1).

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency.

Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance. REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1). In contrast, a compression rate of64appears to be overly aggressive, resulting in\ndiminished performance. These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced.

Figure 11 presents results for various encoder-decoder\ncombinations.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc.

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages\noften exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to\nblock-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks.

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages\noften exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to\nblock-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based\non this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are\nunnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose\nREFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency\nin RAG applications.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025')]"

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time.

Notably,REFRAG8 and REFRAG16\nconsistently outperform other baselines across nearly all settings, while also achieving lower latency than\nCEPE (figure 2). For reference,LLaMA256 uses only the last 256 tokens, matching the number of chunk\nembeddings inREFRAG8 (s/k = 256), yetREFRAG8 consistently surpassesLLaMA256, demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of compressed chunk embeddings.

The perplexity-based selection is an heuristic based selection which compresses\nchunks with low perplexity (Perplexity-desc) or high perplexity (Perplexity-asc).

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks. The policy network leverages\nchunk embeddings and masking to optimize sequential chunk expansion, thereby preserving the decoder’s\nautoregressive property and enabling flexible placement of compression.

With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG).

For reference,LLaMA256 uses only the last 256 tokens, matching the number of chunk\nembeddings inREFRAG8 (s/k = 256), yetREFRAG8 consistently surpassesLLaMA256, demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of compressed chunk embeddings.

The flop rate of the GPU is\nf, and the high bandwidth memory of the GPU ism and we use the compression rate ofk in our encoder. We assume that all our chunk embeddings are precomputed and cached. The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time.

A.1 Modeling REFRAG Selective Compression\nIn this section, we introduce selective token compression, based on the hypothesis that different context\nsegments contribute unequally to answer prediction. Less critical segments are compressed, while essential\nones remain intact, as illustrated in figure 5. We employ RL to train a policy that optimally determines which\nsegments to compress. To enable selective compression, we continue pretraining the encoder and decoder to process a combination\nof token and chunk embeddings.

Notably,REFRAG8 and REFRAG16\nconsistently outperform other baselines across nearly all settings, while also achieving lower latency than\nCEPE (figure 2). For reference,LLaMA256 uses only the last 256 tokens, matching the number of chunk\nembeddings inREFRAG8 (s/k = 256), yetREFRAG8 consistently surpassesLLaMA256, demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of compressed chunk embeddings.

The original Llama-2-7B supports only a4k context window, whereas our approach enables extrapolation via\nchunk embeddings, extending context and supporting broader applications. With a compression rate of16, we achieve a9.3%average log-perplexity improvement over CEPE across\nfour datasets2. Meanwhile, our method is16.53× faster than LLaMA in TTFT and2.01× faster than CEPE\n(section B.4). At a compression rate of32, our log-perplexity matches CEPE, while TTFT acceleration\nincreases to30.85×over LLaMA and3.75×over CEPE. Figure 3 presents the performance of various methods for selective compression. We expandp fraction of the\nchunks in the original token space using the RL policy. The effective compression ratek\n1−p+kp decreases when\nfewer chunks are compressed (i.e.,p increases). We compare the perplexity ofxs+1:s+o using different selection\npolicy under differentp. The perplexity-based selection is an heuristic based selection which compresses\nchunks with low perplexity (Perplexity-desc) or high perplexity (Perplexity-asc). The perplexity is measured\nby the LLaMA-2-7B model. Intuitively, a chunk with lower perplexity contains less information and can\ntherefore be compressed with minimal information loss. Ideally, this approach should outperform random\nselection, which is indeed observed in figure 3.'), Document(metadata={'page': 10, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='7 Conclusion\nIn this work, we introducedREFRAG, a novel and efficient decoding framework tailored for RAG applications. By leveraging the inherent sparsity and block-diagonal attention patterns present in RAG contexts,REFRAG\ncompresses, senses, and expands context representations to significantly reduce both memory usage and\ninference latency, particularly the TTFT. Extensive experiments across a range of long-context applications,\nincluding RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, demonstrate thatREFRAG\nachieves up to30.85× TTFT acceleration (3.75× over previous state-of-the-art methods) without any loss in\nperplexity or downstream accuracy. Our results highlight the importance of specialized treatment for RAG-\nbased systems and open new directions for efficient large-context LLM inference. We believe thatREFRAG\nprovides a practical and scalable solution for deploying LLMs in latency-sensitive, knowledge-intensive\napplications. 8 Acknowledgements\nWe thank for Jason Chen, Yao Liu, Norman Huang, Xueyuan Su, Pranesh Srinivasan, Avinash Atreya, Riham\nMansour, Jeremy Teboul for insightful discussions and support.'), Document(metadata={'page': 22, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='Additional results in RAG.Table 16 shows the performance of different baselines under the same number of\ncontext.

Table 15 shows the performance of our model under different numbers of passages. The result suggests\nthat most tasks still benefit from more passages in our model. Figure 4 shows the performance averaged\nover all 16 tasks in table 3 for both strong retriever and weak retriever setting. The result demonstrates that\nunder the same number of retrieved passages, we are able to match the performance of LLaMA in the strong\nretriever setting and even outperform LLaMA under the weak retriever setting. This is because our model\nenables larger context and hence enables extract more useful information when the retrieved passages are less\nrelevant. Under equivalent latency constraints,REFRAGconsistently outperform LLaMA on both settings\nas the saved context can be reinvested to include additional information within the same latency budget. Figure 4 compares the performance ofREFRAGand the LLaMA model under two conditions: 1) an equal\nnumber of retrieved passages, and 2) equal latency, for both strong and weak retriever settings.With a strong\nretriever and a maximum of 10 passages,REFRAGmatches LLaMA’s performance while achieving a5.26×\nspeedup in TTFT.

For each conversation turn, we\nretrieveKpassages using the same retriever and retrieval corpus as described in section 5.1. Result analysis.Table 4 presents results across varying numbers of conversational turns and retrieved passages. Our model outperformsLLaMAFT on two out of three datasets in the 5-passage setting, and on all three\ndatasets in the 10-passage setting. This improvement is attributable to the limited 4k-token context window of\nLLaMAFT, which necessitates truncating portions of the conversational history in longer contexts, resulting\nin the loss of crucial information required to answer subsequent questions. In contrast, our model, trained on\nthe sameLLaMA model without extending its effective positional encoding, maintains robust performance\n3Note that the implementation of our exact match is stricter than other works.

The perplexity-based selection is an heuristic based selection which compresses\nchunks with low perplexity (Perplexity-desc) or high perplexity (Perplexity-asc).

The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks. The policy network leverages\nchunk embeddings and masking to optimize sequential chunk expansion, thereby preserving the decoder’s\nautoregressive property and enabling flexible placement of compression.

Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)).

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance.

We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time.

Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)). When given a questionx1, .'), Document(metadata={'page': 3, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='In this task, wefreeze the decoder model and only train the encoder and projection layer. The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks. The policy network leverages\nchunk embeddings and masking to optimize sequential chunk expansion, thereby preserving the decoder’s\nautoregressive property and enabling flexible placement of compression. Further discussion on sequential\nselection is provided in section A.1.'), Document(metadata={'page': 16, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='(uncompressed). This arrangement is input to the decoderMdec to predictxs+1:s+o. The decoder’s auto-\nregressive property is maintained, and compression can be applied at any position within the input, not just\nat the beginning. Within our selective compression framework, the objective is to chooseT′ chunks fromL\ntotal chunks to maximize a specified reward. Formally, this can be expressed as the following combinatorial\noptimization problem:\nGiven[L] :={1,2, . . . , L},\nmax\nl⊆[L]\nr(x, l)\ns.t.|l|=T ′\nThis problem is non-differentiable due to its discrete nature, and exact solutions are NP-hard. Consequently,\nprior work has proposed greedy approaches that incrementally construct solutions by modeling the task as a\nsequential decision-making problem (Dai et al., 2017; Bello et al., 2017). These studies show that such greedy\nformulations enable the use of RL to achieve near-optimal solutions and generalize well across diverse settings. Motivated by these findings, we adopt a sequential formulation for selective compression and employ RL to\ntrain an effective policy (see section 2).

Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications.

This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings.

The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al.

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 3, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='In this task, wefreeze the decoder model and only train the encoder and projection layer.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)).

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages\noften exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to\nblock-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks.

Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings.

REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings.

These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance. REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1).

Figure 11 presents results for various encoder-decoder\ncombinations.

The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth.

In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages\noften exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to\nblock-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based\non this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are\nunnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose\nREFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency\nin RAG applications. By exploiting this attention sparsity structure, we demonstrate a30.85× the\ntime-to-first-token acceleration (3.75× improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity.'), Document(metadata={'page': 10, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='7 Conclusion\nIn this work, we introducedREFRAG, a novel and efficient decoding framework tailored for RAG applications. By leveraging the inherent sparsity and block-diagonal attention patterns present in RAG contexts,REFRAG\ncompresses, senses, and expands context representations to significantly reduce both memory usage and\ninference latency, particularly the TTFT. Extensive experiments across a range of long-context applications,\nincluding RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, demonstrate thatREFRAG\nachieves up to30.85× TTFT acceleration (3.75× over previous state-of-the-art methods) without any loss in\nperplexity or downstream accuracy. Our results highlight the importance of specialized treatment for RAG-\nbased systems and open new directions for efficient large-context LLM inference. We believe thatREFRAG\nprovides a practical and scalable solution for deploying LLMs in latency-sensitive, knowledge-intensive\napplications. 8 Acknowledgements\nWe thank for Jason Chen, Yao Liu, Norman Huang, Xueyuan Su, Pranesh Srinivasan, Avinash Atreya, Riham\nMansour, Jeremy Teboul for insightful discussions and support.'), Document(metadata={'page': 4, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='Bolded results compare baselines, excludingLLaMA-Full Contextand LLaMA-32K, which use full\ncontext without compression and are expected to perform best.

The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other.

This finding is particularly surprising, asREFRAG16 achieves a compression rate of8without recomputing\nchunk embeddings, yet still surpasses the performance ofREFRAG8. These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance. REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1). In contrast, a compression rate of64appears to be overly aggressive, resulting in\ndiminished performance. These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced. Different combinations of encoder and decoder models for REFRAG.We employ LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-2-13B\nas decoders, and RoBERTa-Base and RoBERTa-Large as encoders, to investigate how model performance\nvaries with different encoder and decoder sizes. Figure 11 presents results for various encoder-decoder\ncombinations. We observe that increasing the number of parameters in the decoder leads to a substantial\nreduction in loss, whereas enlarging the encoder yields only a modest improvement. This discrepancy may\nbe attributed to the relatively minor increase in size from RoBERTa-Base to RoBERTa-Large compared to\nthe substantial jump from 7B to 13B in the decoder.

Theoretical analysis (section A) shows that for short context lengths, our method achieves up to\nk× acceleration in TTFT and throughput.

By leveraging the inherent sparsity and block-diagonal attention patterns present in RAG contexts,REFRAG\ncompresses, senses, and expands context representations to significantly reduce both memory usage and\ninference latency, particularly the TTFT. Extensive experiments across a range of long-context applications,\nincluding RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, demonstrate thatREFRAG\nachieves up to30.85× TTFT acceleration (3.75× over previous state-of-the-art methods) without any loss in\nperplexity or downstream accuracy. Our results highlight the importance of specialized treatment for RAG-\nbased systems and open new directions for efficient large-context LLM inference.

The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time.

The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to.

A.1 Modeling REFRAG Selective Compression\nIn this section, we introduce selective token compression, based on the hypothesis that different context\nsegments contribute unequally to answer prediction. Less critical segments are compressed, while essential\nones remain intact, as illustrated in figure 5. We employ RL to train a policy that optimally determines which\nsegments to compress. To enable selective compression, we continue pretraining the encoder and decoder to process a combination\nof token and chunk embeddings.

This finding is particularly surprising, asREFRAG16 achieves a compression rate of8without recomputing\nchunk embeddings, yet still surpasses the performance ofREFRAG8. These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance. REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1). In contrast, a compression rate of64appears to be overly aggressive, resulting in\ndiminished performance. These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced. Different combinations of encoder and decoder models for REFRAG.We employ LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-2-13B\nas decoders, and RoBERTa-Base and RoBERTa-Large as encoders, to investigate how model performance\nvaries with different encoder and decoder sizes. Figure 11 presents results for various encoder-decoder\ncombinations. We observe that increasing the number of parameters in the decoder leads to a substantial\nreduction in loss, whereas enlarging the encoder yields only a modest improvement. This discrepancy may\nbe attributed to the relatively minor increase in size from RoBERTa-Base to RoBERTa-Large compared to\nthe substantial jump from 7B to 13B in the decoder. Additional results in figure 12 indicate that a larger\nencoder may not always be advantageous when training with limited data in the continual pre-training setting.'), Document(metadata={'page': 9, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='(2024)\nand Lin et al. (2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements. Complementary approaches\nrank or prune context by estimated informativeness, e.g.,Selective Contextuses self-information to drop\nlow-value tokens, and sentence-level methods learn context-aware encoders for question-specific compression\nand faster inference Li et al.

By leveraging the inherent sparsity and block-diagonal attention patterns present in RAG contexts,REFRAG\ncompresses, senses, and expands context representations to significantly reduce both memory usage and\ninference latency, particularly the TTFT. Extensive experiments across a range of long-context applications,\nincluding RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, demonstrate thatREFRAG\nachieves up to30.85× TTFT acceleration (3.75× over previous state-of-the-art methods) without any loss in\nperplexity or downstream accuracy. Our results highlight the importance of specialized treatment for RAG-\nbased systems and open new directions for efficient large-context LLM inference. We believe thatREFRAG\nprovides a practical and scalable solution for deploying LLMs in latency-sensitive, knowledge-intensive\napplications. 8 Acknowledgements\nWe thank for Jason Chen, Yao Liu, Norman Huang, Xueyuan Su, Pranesh Srinivasan, Avinash Atreya, Riham\nMansour, Jeremy Teboul for insightful discussions and support.')]"

(2024) to use the next paragraph prediction\ntasks for continual pre-training (CPT). Specifically, for each data data point, it containss + o = T number\nof tokens, which we use for CPT to prepare the model for downstream tasks utilizing chunk embeddings. To further enhance performance, we introduce selective compression via RL. After aligning the encoder and\ndecoder through CPT, we apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt the model to specific downstream\ntasks, such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Additional details are provided in section 5. During CPT, we input the firsts tokens x1:s into the encoder and use its output to assist the decoder in\npredicting the nexto tokens xs+1:s+o. This task encourages the model to leverage contextual information for\nnext-paragraph prediction, thereby equipping it for downstream applications. The objective is to align any\nencoder–decoder combination so that the generations produced withcompressed contextclosely resemble\nthose generated by the original decoder with access to the full context. 3.1 Continual Pre-training Recipe\nTo ensure the success of the CPT phase, we propose a training recipe that incorporates a reconstruction task\nand a curriculum learning approach.

The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 .

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements. Complementary approaches\nrank or prune context by estimated informativeness, e.g.,Selective Contextuses self-information to drop\nlow-value tokens, and sentence-level methods learn context-aware encoders for question-specific compression\nand faster inference Li et al.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements. Complementary approaches\nrank or prune context by estimated informativeness, e.g.,Selective Contextuses self-information to drop\nlow-value tokens, and sentence-level methods learn context-aware encoders for question-specific compression\nand faster inference Li et al.

These studies show that such greedy\nformulations enable the use of RL to achieve near-optimal solutions and generalize well across diverse settings.

To further enhance performance, we introduce selective compression via RL. After aligning the encoder and\ndecoder through CPT, we apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt the model to specific downstream\ntasks, such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Additional details are provided in section 5. During CPT, we input the firsts tokens x1:s into the encoder and use its output to assist the decoder in\npredicting the nexto tokens xs+1:s+o.

For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks. The policy network leverages\nchunk embeddings and masking to optimize sequential chunk expansion, thereby preserving the decoder’s\nautoregressive property and enabling flexible placement of compression. Further discussion on sequential\nselection is provided in section A.1.'), Document(metadata={'page': 16, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='(uncompressed). This arrangement is input to the decoderMdec to predictxs+1:s+o. The decoder’s auto-\nregressive property is maintained, and compression can be applied at any position within the input, not just\nat the beginning. Within our selective compression framework, the objective is to chooseT′ chunks fromL\ntotal chunks to maximize a specified reward. Formally, this can be expressed as the following combinatorial\noptimization problem:\nGiven[L] :={1,2, . . . , L},\nmax\nl⊆[L]\nr(x, l)\ns.t.|l|=T ′\nThis problem is non-differentiable due to its discrete nature, and exact solutions are NP-hard. Consequently,\nprior work has proposed greedy approaches that incrementally construct solutions by modeling the task as a\nsequential decision-making problem (Dai et al., 2017; Bello et al., 2017). These studies show that such greedy\nformulations enable the use of RL to achieve near-optimal solutions and generalize well across diverse settings. Motivated by these findings, we adopt a sequential formulation for selective compression and employ RL to\ntrain an effective policy (see section 2).

Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al.

CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al.

Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al.

The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al.

This arrangement is input to the decoderMdec to predictxs+1:s+o. The decoder’s auto-\nregressive property is maintained, and compression can be applied at any position within the input, not just\nat the beginning. Within our selective compression framework, the objective is to chooseT′ chunks fromL\ntotal chunks to maximize a specified reward. Formally, this can be expressed as the following combinatorial\noptimization problem:\nGiven[L] :={1,2, . . . , L},\nmax\nl⊆[L]\nr(x, l)\ns.t.|l|=T ′\nThis problem is non-differentiable due to its discrete nature, and exact solutions are NP-hard. Consequently,\nprior work has proposed greedy approaches that incrementally construct solutions by modeling the task as a\nsequential decision-making problem (Dai et al., 2017; Bello et al., 2017). These studies show that such greedy\nformulations enable the use of RL to achieve near-optimal solutions and generalize well across diverse settings. Motivated by these findings, we adopt a sequential formulation for selective compression and employ RL to\ntrain an effective policy (see section 2).

We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput.

With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to.

After aligning the encoder and\ndecoder through CPT, we apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt the model to specific downstream\ntasks, such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Additional details are provided in section 5. During CPT, we input the firsts tokens x1:s into the encoder and use its output to assist the decoder in\npredicting the nexto tokens xs+1:s+o.

The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth.

Date:October 14, 2025\nCorrespondence:Aritra Ghosh atarighosh@meta.com\nCode:Will be available athttps://github.com/facebookresearch/refrag\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in contextual learning, leveraging\ninformation from their input to achieve superior performance across a range of downstream applications. For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 28, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='our results also indicate that atypicality , non -\ntypicality , and friendly - neighbourhood size are estimates of the\nimportance of instance types for their classification , rather than\ntheir removability . machine learning methods are applied to finding the green s func-\ntion of the anderson impurity model , a basic model system of\nquantum many - body condensed - matter physics . different\nmethods of parametrizing the green s function are investigated ;\na representation in terms of legendre polynomials is found to be\nsuperior due to its limited number of coefficients and its applica-\nbility to state of the art methods of solution . the dependence of\nthe errors on the size of the training set is determined . the results\nindicate that a machine learning approach to dynamical mean -\nfield theory may be feasible . ewe demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be used to\nsolve the quantum many - body problem . we apply the method\nto the anderson impurity model , where we use the exact diago-\nnalization method to train the machine learning algorithms . we\nshow that machine learning is an efficient and accurate method\nto compute the self - energy of the model and to predict the spec-\ntral function of the model . we also show that machine learning\nalgorithms can be used to efficiently compute the self - consistent\ngreen s function starting from any hybridization function . particle swarm optimization is used in several combinatorial op-\ntimization problems . in this work , particle swarms are used to\nsolve quadratic programming problems with quadratic constraints\n. the approach of particle swarms is an example for interior point\nmethods in optimization as an iterative technique . this approach\nis novel and deals with classification problems without the use\nof a traditional classifier . our method determines the optimal\nhyperplane or classification boundary for a data set . in a bi-\nnary classification problem , we constrain each class as a cluster ,\nwhich is enclosed by an ellipsoid . the estimation of the optimal\nhyperplane between the two clusters is posed as a quadratically\nconstrained quadratic problem . the optimization problem is solved\nin distributed format using modified particle swarms . our method\nhas the advantage of using the direction towards optimal solution\nrather than searching the entire feasible region . our results on the\niris , pima , wine , and thyroid datasets show that the proposed\nmethod works better than a neural network and the performance\nis close to that of svm . * keywords * quadratic programming\n; particle swarms ; hyperplane ; quadratic constraints ; binary\nclassification . support vector machines are used for classification of data in\nmachine learning . support vector machines use quadratic pro-\ngramming formulation for minimizing the objective function . the\nquadratic programming problem is solved by particle swarm opti-\nmization . the proposed method is compared with khachiya s and\nkarman s support vector machine algorithms for linear and neural\nnetworks and quadratic programming . the results show that the\nproposed method is better than the other two methods .'), Document(metadata={'page': 6, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='This observation aligns with previous findings by Li et al.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings.

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 1, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='ranging from modifying the attention mechanism’s complexity (Beltagy et al., 2020) to sparsifying attention\nand context (Child et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024), and altering context feeding strategies (Yen\net al., 2024). However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc.

These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance. REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1). In contrast, a compression rate of64appears to be overly aggressive, resulting in\ndiminished performance. These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced.

Figure 11 presents results for various encoder-decoder\ncombinations. We observe that increasing the number of parameters in the decoder leads to a substantial\nreduction in loss, whereas enlarging the encoder yields only a modest improvement. This discrepancy may\nbe attributed to the relatively minor increase in size from RoBERTa-Base to RoBERTa-Large compared to\nthe substantial jump from 7B to 13B in the decoder.

Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)). When given a questionx1, .')]"

The flop rate of the GPU is\nf, and the high bandwidth memory of the GPU ism and we use the compression rate ofk in our encoder. We assume that all our chunk embeddings are precomputed and cached. The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time. Overall we achieve upto6.78× and\n6.06×acceleration in throughput much higher than CEPE in the long context scenario.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)).

The flop rate of the GPU is\nf, and the high bandwidth memory of the GPU ism and we use the compression rate ofk in our encoder. We assume that all our chunk embeddings are precomputed and cached. The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time. Overall we achieve upto6.78× and\n6.06×acceleration in throughput much higher than CEPE in the long context scenario.

These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance. REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1). In contrast, a compression rate of64appears to be overly aggressive, resulting in\ndiminished performance. These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced.

Figure 11 presents results for various encoder-decoder\ncombinations.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages\noften exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to\nblock-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based\non this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are\nunnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose\nREFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency\nin RAG applications.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work.

We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance. REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1).

While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)). When given a questionx1, .'), Document(metadata={'page': 0, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='REFRAG: Rethinking RAG based Decoding\nXiaoqiang Lin1,2,∗,Aritra Ghosh1,Bryan Kian Hsiang Low2,Anshumali Shrivastava1,3,Vijai Mohan1\n1Meta Superintelligence Labs,2National University of Singapore,3Rice University\n∗Work done at Meta\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive\nexternal knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-\naugmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages\noften exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to\nblock-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based\non this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are\nunnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose\nREFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency\nin RAG applications. By exploiting this attention sparsity structure, we demonstrate a30.85× the\ntime-to-first-token acceleration (3.75× improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity.'), Document(metadata={'page': 9, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='(2024)\nand Lin et al. (2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

This finding is particularly surprising, asREFRAG16 achieves a compression rate of8without recomputing\nchunk embeddings, yet still surpasses the performance ofREFRAG8. These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance. REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1). In contrast, a compression rate of64appears to be overly aggressive, resulting in\ndiminished performance. These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced. Different combinations of encoder and decoder models for REFRAG.We employ LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-2-13B\nas decoders, and RoBERTa-Base and RoBERTa-Large as encoders, to investigate how model performance\nvaries with different encoder and decoder sizes. Figure 11 presents results for various encoder-decoder\ncombinations. We observe that increasing the number of parameters in the decoder leads to a substantial\nreduction in loss, whereas enlarging the encoder yields only a modest improvement. This discrepancy may\nbe attributed to the relatively minor increase in size from RoBERTa-Base to RoBERTa-Large compared to\nthe substantial jump from 7B to 13B in the decoder.

The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form.

(2024) to use the next paragraph prediction\ntasks for continual pre-training (CPT). Specifically, for each data data point, it containss + o = T number\nof tokens, which we use for CPT to prepare the model for downstream tasks utilizing chunk embeddings. To further enhance performance, we introduce selective compression via RL. After aligning the encoder and\ndecoder through CPT, we apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt the model to specific downstream\ntasks, such as RAG and multi-turn conversation.

The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8.

(2024) to use the next paragraph prediction\ntasks for continual pre-training (CPT). Specifically, for each data data point, it containss + o = T number\nof tokens, which we use for CPT to prepare the model for downstream tasks utilizing chunk embeddings. To further enhance performance, we introduce selective compression via RL. After aligning the encoder and\ndecoder through CPT, we apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt the model to specific downstream\ntasks, such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Additional details are provided in section 5. During CPT, we input the firsts tokens x1:s into the encoder and use its output to assist the decoder in\npredicting the nexto tokens xs+1:s+o. This task encourages the model to leverage contextual information for\nnext-paragraph prediction, thereby equipping it for downstream applications. The objective is to align any\nencoder–decoder combination so that the generations produced withcompressed contextclosely resemble\nthose generated by the original decoder with access to the full context. 3.1 Continual Pre-training Recipe\nTo ensure the success of the CPT phase, we propose a training recipe that incorporates a reconstruction task\nand a curriculum learning approach. Ablation studies in section 4 demonstrate thatthis recipeiscrucialfor\nachieving strong CPT performance.

The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al.

StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings.

This finding is particularly surprising, asREFRAG16 achieves a compression rate of8without recomputing\nchunk embeddings, yet still surpasses the performance ofREFRAG8. These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance. REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1). In contrast, a compression rate of64appears to be overly aggressive, resulting in\ndiminished performance. These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced.

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency.

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 23, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='Table 15 shows the performance ofREFRAGunder different number of context for\nstrong retriever setting.

REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1).

These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced.

Figure 11 presents results for various encoder-decoder\ncombinations.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements. Complementary approaches\nrank or prune context by estimated informativeness, e.g.,Selective Contextuses self-information to drop\nlow-value tokens, and sentence-level methods learn context-aware encoders for question-specific compression\nand faster inference Li et al. (2023); Liskavets et al.'), Document(metadata={'page': 6, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='This observation aligns with previous findings by Li et al. (2024), which demonstrate that larger encoders in\nmulti-modal models can negatively impact performance when data is scarce. To further validate our training\napproach on other decoder models, we conduct experiments with LLaMA-3.1-8B and LLaMA-3.2-3B. Table 14\nreports the performance of these models paired with RoBERTa-Base and RoBERTa-Large encoders on the\nArxiv domain.

The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time.

REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1). In contrast, a compression rate of64appears to be overly aggressive, resulting in\ndiminished performance. These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced.

Figure 11 presents results for various encoder-decoder\ncombinations.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

This finding is particularly surprising, asREFRAG16 achieves a compression rate of8without recomputing\nchunk embeddings, yet still surpasses the performance ofREFRAG8. These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance. REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1). In contrast, a compression rate of64appears to be overly aggressive, resulting in\ndiminished performance. These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced. Different combinations of encoder and decoder models for REFRAG.We employ LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-2-13B\nas decoders, and RoBERTa-Base and RoBERTa-Large as encoders, to investigate how model performance\nvaries with different encoder and decoder sizes. Figure 11 presents results for various encoder-decoder\ncombinations. We observe that increasing the number of parameters in the decoder leads to a substantial\nreduction in loss, whereas enlarging the encoder yields only a modest improvement. This discrepancy may\nbe attributed to the relatively minor increase in size from RoBERTa-Base to RoBERTa-Large compared to\nthe substantial jump from 7B to 13B in the decoder. Additional results in figure 12 indicate that a larger\nencoder may not always be advantageous when training with limited data in the continual pre-training setting.'), Document(metadata={'page': 6, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='This observation aligns with previous findings by Li et al.

For reference,LLaMA256 uses only the last 256 tokens, matching the number of chunk\nembeddings inREFRAG8 (s/k = 256), yetREFRAG8 consistently surpassesLLaMA256, demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of compressed chunk embeddings.

The effective compression ratek\n1−p+kp decreases when\nfewer chunks are compressed (i.e.,p increases). We compare the perplexity ofxs+1:s+o using different selection\npolicy under differentp. The perplexity-based selection is an heuristic based selection which compresses\nchunks with low perplexity (Perplexity-desc) or high perplexity (Perplexity-asc).

Result analysis.Table 4 presents results across varying numbers of conversational turns and retrieved passages. Our model outperformsLLaMAFT on two out of three datasets in the 5-passage setting, and on all three\ndatasets in the 10-passage setting. This improvement is attributable to the limited 4k-token context window of\nLLaMAFT, which necessitates truncating portions of the conversational history in longer contexts, resulting\nin the loss of crucial information required to answer subsequent questions. In contrast, our model, trained on\nthe sameLLaMA model without extending its effective positional encoding, maintains robust performance\n3Note that the implementation of our exact match is stricter than other works.

The flop rate of the GPU is\nf, and the high bandwidth memory of the GPU ism and we use the compression rate ofk in our encoder. We assume that all our chunk embeddings are precomputed and cached. The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time.

We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc.

The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time.

(2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements. Complementary approaches\nrank or prune context by estimated informativeness, e.g.,Selective Contextuses self-information to drop\nlow-value tokens, and sentence-level methods learn context-aware encoders for question-specific compression\nand faster inference Li et al.

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications.

The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to.

We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1).

The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks.

We\ncompare the performance under both the short context and the long context scenarios. For the short context,\nwe use 1 passage forLLaMAFT and use 8 passages for all our models. The baseline ofREFRAG8 will\nhave the same latency as theLLaMAFT model. However, due to the compression, we are able to have more\ncontext information and hence achieve better performance.

For reference,LLaMA256 uses only the last 256 tokens, matching the number of chunk\nembeddings inREFRAG8 (s/k = 256), yetREFRAG8 consistently surpassesLLaMA256, demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of compressed chunk embeddings.

The perplexity-based selection is an heuristic based selection which compresses\nchunks with low perplexity (Perplexity-desc) or high perplexity (Perplexity-asc). The perplexity is measured\nby the LLaMA-2-7B model. Intuitively, a chunk with lower perplexity contains less information and can\ntherefore be compressed with minimal information loss.

This finding is particularly surprising, asREFRAG16 achieves a compression rate of8without recomputing\nchunk embeddings, yet still surpasses the performance ofREFRAG8. These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance. REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1). In contrast, a compression rate of64appears to be overly aggressive, resulting in\ndiminished performance. These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced. Different combinations of encoder and decoder models for REFRAG.We employ LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-2-13B\nas decoders, and RoBERTa-Base and RoBERTa-Large as encoders, to investigate how model performance\nvaries with different encoder and decoder sizes. Figure 11 presents results for various encoder-decoder\ncombinations. We observe that increasing the number of parameters in the decoder leads to a substantial\nreduction in loss, whereas enlarging the encoder yields only a modest improvement. This discrepancy may\nbe attributed to the relatively minor increase in size from RoBERTa-Base to RoBERTa-Large compared to\nthe substantial jump from 7B to 13B in the decoder. Additional results in figure 12 indicate that a larger\nencoder may not always be advantageous when training with limited data in the continual pre-training setting.'), Document(metadata={'page': 7, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='Our model has even higher performance gains in multi-choice\ntasks. Table 15 shows the performance of our model under different numbers of passages. The result suggests\nthat most tasks still benefit from more passages in our model. Figure 4 shows the performance averaged\nover all 16 tasks in table 3 for both strong retriever and weak retriever setting. The result demonstrates that\nunder the same number of retrieved passages, we are able to match the performance of LLaMA in the strong\nretriever setting and even outperform LLaMA under the weak retriever setting. This is because our model\nenables larger context and hence enables extract more useful information when the retrieved passages are less\nrelevant. Under equivalent latency constraints,REFRAGconsistently outperform LLaMA on both settings\nas the saved context can be reinvested to include additional information within the same latency budget. Figure 4 compares the performance ofREFRAGand the LLaMA model under two conditions: 1) an equal\nnumber of retrieved passages, and 2) equal latency, for both strong and weak retriever settings.With a strong\nretriever and a maximum of 10 passages,REFRAGmatches LLaMA’s performance while achieving a5.26×\nspeedup in TTFT. At equal latency (8 passages forREFRAGvs. 1 for LLaMA),REFRAGattains a1.22%\naverage improvement across 16 RAG tasks.

At equal latency (8 passages for\nREFRAGvs. 1 for LLaMA),REFRAGachieves a1.93%average gain over 16 RAG tasks. 5.2 Multi-Turn Conversation\nWe use three different knowledge-intensive multi-turn conversation datasets: TopiOCQA (Adlakha et al.,\n2022), ORConvQA (Qu et al., 2020), and QReCC (Anantha et al., 2021). For each conversation turn, we\nretrieveKpassages using the same retriever and retrieval corpus as described in section 5.1. Result analysis.Table 4 presents results across varying numbers of conversational turns and retrieved passages. Our model outperformsLLaMAFT on two out of three datasets in the 5-passage setting, and on all three\ndatasets in the 10-passage setting. This improvement is attributable to the limited 4k-token context window of\nLLaMAFT, which necessitates truncating portions of the conversational history in longer contexts, resulting\nin the loss of crucial information required to answer subsequent questions. In contrast, our model, trained on\nthe sameLLaMA model without extending its effective positional encoding, maintains robust performance\n3Note that the implementation of our exact match is stricter than other works.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)). When given a questionx1, .'), Document(metadata={'page': 9, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='(2024)\nand Lin et al. (2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements. Complementary approaches\nrank or prune context by estimated informativeness, e.g.,Selective Contextuses self-information to drop\nlow-value tokens, and sentence-level methods learn context-aware encoders for question-specific compression\nand faster inference Li et al.

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages\noften exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to\nblock-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based\non this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are\nunnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose\nREFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency\nin RAG applications.

We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1). In contrast, a compression rate of64appears to be overly aggressive, resulting in\ndiminished performance. These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced. Different combinations of encoder and decoder models for REFRAG.We employ LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-2-13B\nas decoders, and RoBERTa-Base and RoBERTa-Large as encoders, to investigate how model performance\nvaries with different encoder and decoder sizes.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)). When given a questionx1, .'), Document(metadata={'page': 9, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='(2024)\nand Lin et al. (2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query.

REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings.

This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)).

Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability.

This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements. Complementary approaches\nrank or prune context by estimated informativeness, e.g.,Selective Contextuses self-information to drop\nlow-value tokens, and sentence-level methods learn context-aware encoders for question-specific compression\nand faster inference Li et al.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)). When given a questionx1, .'), Document(metadata={'page': 3, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='In this task, wefreeze the decoder model and only train the encoder and projection layer. The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth.

REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context.

This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings.

This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings.

With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to.

The perplexity-based selection is an heuristic based selection which compresses\nchunks with low perplexity (Perplexity-desc) or high perplexity (Perplexity-asc).

Specifically, for each data data point, it containss + o = T number\nof tokens, which we use for CPT to prepare the model for downstream tasks utilizing chunk embeddings. To further enhance performance, we introduce selective compression via RL. After aligning the encoder and\ndecoder through CPT, we apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt the model to specific downstream\ntasks, such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Additional details are provided in section 5. During CPT, we input the firsts tokens x1:s into the encoder and use its output to assist the decoder in\npredicting the nexto tokens xs+1:s+o. This task encourages the model to leverage contextual information for\nnext-paragraph prediction, thereby equipping it for downstream applications.

Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder.

The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other.

As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings).

The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache.

With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

This finding is particularly surprising, asREFRAG16 achieves a compression rate of8without recomputing\nchunk embeddings, yet still surpasses the performance ofREFRAG8. These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance. REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1). In contrast, a compression rate of64appears to be overly aggressive, resulting in\ndiminished performance. These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced. Different combinations of encoder and decoder models for REFRAG.We employ LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-2-13B\nas decoders, and RoBERTa-Base and RoBERTa-Large as encoders, to investigate how model performance\nvaries with different encoder and decoder sizes. Figure 11 presents results for various encoder-decoder\ncombinations. We observe that increasing the number of parameters in the decoder leads to a substantial\nreduction in loss, whereas enlarging the encoder yields only a modest improvement. This discrepancy may\nbe attributed to the relatively minor increase in size from RoBERTa-Base to RoBERTa-Large compared to\nthe substantial jump from 7B to 13B in the decoder. Additional results in figure 12 indicate that a larger\nencoder may not always be advantageous when training with limited data in the continual pre-training setting.'), Document(metadata={'page': 1, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='ranging from modifying the attention mechanism’s complexity (Beltagy et al., 2020) to sparsifying attention\nand context (Child et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024), and altering context feeding strategies (Yen\net al., 2024). However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

(2024) to use the next paragraph prediction\ntasks for continual pre-training (CPT). Specifically, for each data data point, it containss + o = T number\nof tokens, which we use for CPT to prepare the model for downstream tasks utilizing chunk embeddings. To further enhance performance, we introduce selective compression via RL. After aligning the encoder and\ndecoder through CPT, we apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt the model to specific downstream\ntasks, such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Additional details are provided in section 5. During CPT, we input the firsts tokens x1:s into the encoder and use its output to assist the decoder in\npredicting the nexto tokens xs+1:s+o. This task encourages the model to leverage contextual information for\nnext-paragraph prediction, thereby equipping it for downstream applications. The objective is to align any\nencoder–decoder combination so that the generations produced withcompressed contextclosely resemble\nthose generated by the original decoder with access to the full context. 3.1 Continual Pre-training Recipe\nTo ensure the success of the CPT phase, we propose a training recipe that incorporates a reconstruction task\nand a curriculum learning approach. Ablation studies in section 4 demonstrate thatthis recipeiscrucialfor\nachieving strong CPT performance.

The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks. The policy network leverages\nchunk embeddings and masking to optimize sequential chunk expansion, thereby preserving the decoder’s\nautoregressive property and enabling flexible placement of compression.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)).

The decoder’s auto-\nregressive property is maintained, and compression can be applied at any position within the input, not just\nat the beginning. Within our selective compression framework, the objective is to chooseT′ chunks fromL\ntotal chunks to maximize a specified reward. Formally, this can be expressed as the following combinatorial\noptimization problem:\nGiven[L] :={1,2, . . . , L},\nmax\nl⊆[L]\nr(x, l)\ns.t.|l|=T ′\nThis problem is non-differentiable due to its discrete nature, and exact solutions are NP-hard.

We follow the work of Lin et al.'), Document(metadata={'page': 1, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='ranging from modifying the attention mechanism’s complexity (Beltagy et al., 2020) to sparsifying attention\nand context (Child et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024), and altering context feeding strategies (Yen\net al., 2024). However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc.

The flop rate of the GPU is\nf, and the high bandwidth memory of the GPU ism and we use the compression rate ofk in our encoder. We assume that all our chunk embeddings are precomputed and cached. The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time. Overall we achieve upto6.78× and\n6.06×acceleration in throughput much higher than CEPE in the long context scenario.

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages\noften exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to\nblock-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based\non this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are\nunnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose\nREFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency\nin RAG applications. By exploiting this attention sparsity structure, we demonstrate a30.85× the\ntime-to-first-token acceleration (3.75× improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity.'), Document(metadata={'page': 1, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='ranging from modifying the attention mechanism’s complexity (Beltagy et al., 2020) to sparsifying attention\nand context (Child et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024), and altering context feeding strategies (Yen\net al., 2024). However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

This finding is particularly surprising, asREFRAG16 achieves a compression rate of8without recomputing\nchunk embeddings, yet still surpasses the performance ofREFRAG8. These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance. REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1). In contrast, a compression rate of64appears to be overly aggressive, resulting in\ndiminished performance. These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced. Different combinations of encoder and decoder models for REFRAG.We employ LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-2-13B\nas decoders, and RoBERTa-Base and RoBERTa-Large as encoders, to investigate how model performance\nvaries with different encoder and decoder sizes. Figure 11 presents results for various encoder-decoder\ncombinations. We observe that increasing the number of parameters in the decoder leads to a substantial\nreduction in loss, whereas enlarging the encoder yields only a modest improvement. This discrepancy may\nbe attributed to the relatively minor increase in size from RoBERTa-Base to RoBERTa-Large compared to\nthe substantial jump from 7B to 13B in the decoder. Additional results in figure 12 indicate that a larger\nencoder may not always be advantageous when training with limited data in the continual pre-training setting.'), Document(metadata={'page': 7, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='Evaluation dataset.We hold out 5% of the data for each dataset in the training dataset for evaluation.

Our model outperformsLLaMAFT on two out of three datasets in the 5-passage setting, and on all three\ndatasets in the 10-passage setting. This improvement is attributable to the limited 4k-token context window of\nLLaMAFT, which necessitates truncating portions of the conversational history in longer contexts, resulting\nin the loss of crucial information required to answer subsequent questions. In contrast, our model, trained on\nthe sameLLaMA model without extending its effective positional encoding, maintains robust performance\n3Note that the implementation of our exact match is stricter than other works.

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages\noften exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to\nblock-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based\non this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are\nunnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose\nREFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency\nin RAG applications.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements. Complementary approaches\nrank or prune context by estimated informativeness, e.g.,Selective Contextuses self-information to drop\nlow-value tokens, and sentence-level methods learn context-aware encoders for question-specific compression\nand faster inference Li et al. (2023); Liskavets et al.'), Document(metadata={'page': 3, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='on empirical evaluation is in section A. 3 Methodology\nTo align the encoder and decoder, we follow the work of Yen et al. (2024) to use the next paragraph prediction\ntasks for continual pre-training (CPT). Specifically, for each data data point, it containss + o = T number\nof tokens, which we use for CPT to prepare the model for downstream tasks utilizing chunk embeddings. To further enhance performance, we introduce selective compression via RL. After aligning the encoder and\ndecoder through CPT, we apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt the model to specific downstream\ntasks, such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Additional details are provided in section 5. During CPT, we input the firsts tokens x1:s into the encoder and use its output to assist the decoder in\npredicting the nexto tokens xs+1:s+o. This task encourages the model to leverage contextual information for\nnext-paragraph prediction, thereby equipping it for downstream applications. The objective is to align any\nencoder–decoder combination so that the generations produced withcompressed contextclosely resemble\nthose generated by the original decoder with access to the full context. 3.1 Continual Pre-training Recipe\nTo ensure the success of the CPT phase, we propose a training recipe that incorporates a reconstruction task\nand a curriculum learning approach.

This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al.

It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture.

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 0, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='REFRAG: Rethinking RAG based Decoding\nXiaoqiang Lin1,2,∗,Aritra Ghosh1,Bryan Kian Hsiang Low2,Anshumali Shrivastava1,3,Vijai Mohan1\n1Meta Superintelligence Labs,2National University of Singapore,3Rice University\n∗Work done at Meta\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive\nexternal knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-\naugmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)). When given a questionx1, .'), Document(metadata={'page': 3, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='In this task, wefreeze the decoder model and only train the encoder and projection layer. The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG).

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications.

Moreover, increasing the context length continues to benefit our model,\nas evidenced by lower perplexity for a context length of4096compared to2048. 5 Contextual Learning Applications\nIn this section, we investigate fine-tuning the model obtained from the pre-training stage to address various\ndownstream tasks, including RAG, long document summarization, and multi-turn conversation with RAG. For each application, we curate an instruction-tuning dataset to facilitate model fine-tuning. 5.1 Retrieval Augmented Generation\nTraining dataset.We follow the work of Lin et al.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG. This model consists of a decoder-only\nfoundation model (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and a lightweight encoder model (e.g., Roberta (Liu\net al., 2019)). When given a questionx1, .'), Document(metadata={'page': 3, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='In this task, wefreeze the decoder model and only train the encoder and projection layer. The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks. The policy network leverages\nchunk embeddings and masking to optimize sequential chunk expansion, thereby preserving the decoder’s\nautoregressive property and enabling flexible placement of compression.

Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al.

It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al.

However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability.

The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to.

Date:October 14, 2025\nCorrespondence:Aritra Ghosh atarighosh@meta.com\nCode:Will be available athttps://github.com/facebookresearch/refrag\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in contextual learning, leveraging\ninformation from their input to achieve superior performance across a range of downstream applications. For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 5, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='Reconstruction task is essential for the model to learn the continual pre-training task.Table 12 shows the\nperformance of the continual pre-training task with and without initialization from the reconstruction task.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

Date:October 14, 2025\nCorrespondence:Aritra Ghosh atarighosh@meta.com\nCode:Will be available athttps://github.com/facebookresearch/refrag\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in contextual learning, leveraging\ninformation from their input to achieve superior performance across a range of downstream applications. For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025')]"

With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time. Overall we achieve upto6.78× and\n6.06×acceleration in throughput much higher than CEPE in the long context scenario.

A.1 Modeling REFRAG Selective Compression\nIn this section, we introduce selective token compression, based on the hypothesis that different context\nsegments contribute unequally to answer prediction. Less critical segments are compressed, while essential\nones remain intact, as illustrated in figure 5. We employ RL to train a policy that optimally determines which\nsegments to compress. To enable selective compression, we continue pretraining the encoder and decoder to process a combination\nof token and chunk embeddings.

Latency and throughput improvement.We evaluate three metrics: TTFT, the latency to generate the first\ntoken; TTIT, the time to generate each subsequent token; and Throughput, the number of tokens generated\nper unit time. Theoretical analysis (section A) shows that for short context lengths, our method achieves up to\nk× acceleration in TTFT and throughput. For longer context length, acceleration reaches up tok2× for both\nmetrics. Empirically, as shown in figure 2, with a context length of16384(mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nwith k = 16achieves16 .53× TTFT acceleration with cache and8.59× without cache1, both surpassing CEPE\n(2.01× and1 .04×, respectively), while achieving 9.3% performance (measured by log-perplexity) compared\nto CEPE (table 1). We achieve up to6.78× throughput acceleration compared to LLaMA, significantly\noutperforming CEPE. Withk = 32, TTFT acceleration reaches32.99× compared to LLaMA (3.75× compared\nto CEPE) while maintaining similar performance to CEPE (see figure 8 and table 2).

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025')]"

The\nmain objectives are to align the encoder and projection layer so that: 1) encoder can compressk tokens with\nminimal information loss, and 2) projection layer can effectively map the encoder’s chunk embeddings into the\ndecoder’s token space, allowing the decoder to interpret and accurately reconstruct the original information. The reconstruction task was specifically chosen to encourage the model to rely on context memory rather\nthan its parametric memory during training. Once the encoder is aligned with the decoder through this\nreconstruction task, we initiate CPT byunfreezing the decoder. Curriculum learning.The training tasks described in the previous section may seem straightforward, but they\nare inherently complex. As the chunk lengthk increases, the number of possible token combinations expands\nexponentially, specifically at a rate ofV k, whereV is the vocabulary size. Effectively capturing this diversity\nwithin a fixed-length embedding presents a significant challenge. Additionally, reconstructings = k×L tokens\nfromLchunk embeddings further compounds the difficulty of the task. Counterintuitively, directly continuing pre-training of the decoder to utilize encoder outputs did not reduce\nperplexity, even for the reconstruction task.To address the optimization challenge, we propose employing\ncurriculum learning for both tasks. Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting\ntowards those dominated by more difficult tasks (i.e.,L chunk embeddings). A visualization of the data\nmixture during curriculum learning is provided in figure 6, and the detailed scheduling is presented in table 8. Selective compressionREFRAGintroduces selective token compression, expanding important context chunks\nuncompressed to improve answer prediction. A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks.

To further enhance performance, we introduce selective compression via RL. After aligning the encoder and\ndecoder through CPT, we apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt the model to specific downstream\ntasks, such as RAG and multi-turn conversation.

A RL policy, guided by next-paragraph prediction perplexity as\na negative reward, determines which chunks to retain in their original form. The encoder and decoder are\nfine-tuned to handle mixed inputs of compressed and uncompressed chunks.

(2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages\noften exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to\nblock-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based\non this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are\nunnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose\nREFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency\nin RAG applications. By exploiting this attention sparsity structure, we demonstrate a30.85× the\ntime-to-first-token acceleration (3.75× improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity.'), Document(metadata={'page': 1, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='ranging from modifying the attention mechanism’s complexity (Beltagy et al., 2020) to sparsifying attention\nand context (Child et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024), and altering context feeding strategies (Yen\net al., 2024). However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc.

Date:October 14, 2025\nCorrespondence:Aritra Ghosh atarighosh@meta.com\nCode:Will be available athttps://github.com/facebookresearch/refrag\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in contextual learning, leveraging\ninformation from their input to achieve superior performance across a range of downstream applications. For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 10, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='7 Conclusion\nIn this work, we introducedREFRAG, a novel and efficient decoding framework tailored for RAG applications. By leveraging the inherent sparsity and block-diagonal attention patterns present in RAG contexts,REFRAG\ncompresses, senses, and expands context representations to significantly reduce both memory usage and\ninference latency, particularly the TTFT. Extensive experiments across a range of long-context applications,\nincluding RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, demonstrate thatREFRAG\nachieves up to30.85× TTFT acceleration (3.75× over previous state-of-the-art methods) without any loss in\nperplexity or downstream accuracy. Our results highlight the importance of specialized treatment for RAG-\nbased systems and open new directions for efficient large-context LLM inference. We believe thatREFRAG\nprovides a practical and scalable solution for deploying LLMs in latency-sensitive, knowledge-intensive\napplications. 8 Acknowledgements\nWe thank for Jason Chen, Yao Liu, Norman Huang, Xueyuan Su, Pranesh Srinivasan, Avinash Atreya, Riham\nMansour, Jeremy Teboul for insightful discussions and support.'), Document(metadata={'page': 0, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='REFRAG: Rethinking RAG based Decoding\nXiaoqiang Lin1,2,∗,Aritra Ghosh1,Bryan Kian Hsiang Low2,Anshumali Shrivastava1,3,Vijai Mohan1\n1Meta Superintelligence Labs,2National University of Singapore,3Rice University\n∗Work done at Meta\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive\nexternal knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-\naugmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages\noften exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to\nblock-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based\non this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are\nunnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose\nREFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency\nin RAG applications.

The flop rate of the GPU is\nf, and the high bandwidth memory of the GPU ism and we use the compression rate ofk in our encoder. We assume that all our chunk embeddings are precomputed and cached. The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time. Overall we achieve upto6.78× and\n6.06×acceleration in throughput much higher than CEPE in the long context scenario.

Less critical segments are compressed, while essential\nones remain intact, as illustrated in figure 5. We employ RL to train a policy that optimally determines which\nsegments to compress. To enable selective compression, we continue pretraining the encoder and decoder to process a combination\nof token and chunk embeddings.

The result demonstrates that\nunder the same number of retrieved passages, we are able to match the performance of LLaMA in the strong\nretriever setting and even outperform LLaMA under the weak retriever setting. This is because our model\nenables larger context and hence enables extract more useful information when the retrieved passages are less\nrelevant. Under equivalent latency constraints,REFRAGconsistently outperform LLaMA on both settings\nas the saved context can be reinvested to include additional information within the same latency budget. Figure 4 compares the performance ofREFRAGand the LLaMA model under two conditions: 1) an equal\nnumber of retrieved passages, and 2) equal latency, for both strong and weak retriever settings.With a strong\nretriever and a maximum of 10 passages,REFRAGmatches LLaMA’s performance while achieving a5.26×\nspeedup in TTFT.

For each conversation turn, we\nretrieveKpassages using the same retriever and retrieval corpus as described in section 5.1. Result analysis.Table 4 presents results across varying numbers of conversational turns and retrieved passages. Our model outperformsLLaMAFT on two out of three datasets in the 5-passage setting, and on all three\ndatasets in the 10-passage setting. This improvement is attributable to the limited 4k-token context window of\nLLaMAFT, which necessitates truncating portions of the conversational history in longer contexts, resulting\nin the loss of crucial information required to answer subsequent questions. In contrast, our model, trained on\nthe sameLLaMA model without extending its effective positional encoding, maintains robust performance\n3Note that the implementation of our exact match is stricter than other works.

This finding is particularly surprising, asREFRAG16 achieves a compression rate of8without recomputing\nchunk embeddings, yet still surpasses the performance ofREFRAG8. These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance. REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1). In contrast, a compression rate of64appears to be overly aggressive, resulting in\ndiminished performance. These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced.

The flop rate of the GPU is\nf, and the high bandwidth memory of the GPU ism and we use the compression rate ofk in our encoder. We assume that all our chunk embeddings are precomputed and cached. The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time. Overall we achieve upto6.78× and\n6.06×acceleration in throughput much higher than CEPE in the long context scenario.

A.1 Modeling REFRAG Selective Compression\nIn this section, we introduce selective token compression, based on the hypothesis that different context\nsegments contribute unequally to answer prediction. Less critical segments are compressed, while essential\nones remain intact, as illustrated in figure 5. We employ RL to train a policy that optimally determines which\nsegments to compress. To enable selective compression, we continue pretraining the encoder and decoder to process a combination\nof token and chunk embeddings.

This finding is particularly surprising, asREFRAG16 achieves a compression rate of8without recomputing\nchunk embeddings, yet still surpasses the performance ofREFRAG8. These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance. REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1). In contrast, a compression rate of64appears to be overly aggressive, resulting in\ndiminished performance. These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced.

Figure 11 presents results for various encoder-decoder\ncombinations.

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications.

These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance.

These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced. Different combinations of encoder and decoder models for REFRAG.We employ LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-2-13B\nas decoders, and RoBERTa-Base and RoBERTa-Large as encoders, to investigate how model performance\nvaries with different encoder and decoder sizes. Figure 11 presents results for various encoder-decoder\ncombinations. We observe that increasing the number of parameters in the decoder leads to a substantial\nreduction in loss, whereas enlarging the encoder yields only a modest improvement. This discrepancy may\nbe attributed to the relatively minor increase in size from RoBERTa-Base to RoBERTa-Large compared to\nthe substantial jump from 7B to 13B in the decoder. Additional results in figure 12 indicate that a larger\nencoder may not always be advantageous when training with limited data in the continual pre-training setting.'), Document(metadata={'page': 9, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='(2024)\nand Lin et al. (2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements. Complementary approaches\nrank or prune context by estimated informativeness, e.g.,Selective Contextuses self-information to drop\nlow-value tokens, and sentence-level methods learn context-aware encoders for question-specific compression\nand faster inference Li et al.

The flop rate of the GPU is\nf, and the high bandwidth memory of the GPU ism and we use the compression rate ofk in our encoder. We assume that all our chunk embeddings are precomputed and cached. The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time. Overall we achieve upto6.78× and\n6.06×acceleration in throughput much higher than CEPE in the long context scenario.

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 4, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='Bolded results compare baselines, excludingLLaMA-Full Contextand LLaMA-32K, which use full\ncontext without compression and are expected to perform best. Notably,REFRAG8 and REFRAG16\nconsistently outperform other baselines across nearly all settings, while also achieving lower latency than\nCEPE (figure 2). For reference,LLaMA256 uses only the last 256 tokens, matching the number of chunk\nembeddings inREFRAG8 (s/k = 256), yetREFRAG8 consistently surpassesLLaMA256, demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of compressed chunk embeddings. Table 2 evaluateso = 2048with extended context lengthss∈ {4096, 8192, 16384}. Although our model is\ntrained ons + o = 6144, bothREFRAG8 and REFRAG16 maintain superior performance at longer contexts. The original Llama-2-7B supports only a4k context window, whereas our approach enables extrapolation via\nchunk embeddings, extending context and supporting broader applications. With a compression rate of16, we achieve a9.3%average log-perplexity improvement over CEPE across\nfour datasets2. Meanwhile, our method is16.53× faster than LLaMA in TTFT and2.01× faster than CEPE\n(section B.4). At a compression rate of32, our log-perplexity matches CEPE, while TTFT acceleration\nincreases to30.85×over LLaMA and3.75×over CEPE. Figure 3 presents the performance of various methods for selective compression. We expandp fraction of the\nchunks in the original token space using the RL policy. The effective compression ratek\n1−p+kp decreases when\nfewer chunks are compressed (i.e.,p increases). We compare the perplexity ofxs+1:s+o using different selection\npolicy under differentp. The perplexity-based selection is an heuristic based selection which compresses\nchunks with low perplexity (Perplexity-desc) or high perplexity (Perplexity-asc). The perplexity is measured\nby the LLaMA-2-7B model. Intuitively, a chunk with lower perplexity contains less information and can\ntherefore be compressed with minimal information loss. Ideally, this approach should outperform random\nselection, which is indeed observed in figure 3.'), Document(metadata={'page': 7, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='Our model has even higher performance gains in multi-choice\ntasks. Table 15 shows the performance of our model under different numbers of passages. The result suggests\nthat most tasks still benefit from more passages in our model. Figure 4 shows the performance averaged\nover all 16 tasks in table 3 for both strong retriever and weak retriever setting. The result demonstrates that\nunder the same number of retrieved passages, we are able to match the performance of LLaMA in the strong\nretriever setting and even outperform LLaMA under the weak retriever setting. This is because our model\nenables larger context and hence enables extract more useful information when the retrieved passages are less\nrelevant. Under equivalent latency constraints,REFRAGconsistently outperform LLaMA on both settings\nas the saved context can be reinvested to include additional information within the same latency budget. Figure 4 compares the performance ofREFRAGand the LLaMA model under two conditions: 1) an equal\nnumber of retrieved passages, and 2) equal latency, for both strong and weak retriever settings.With a strong\nretriever and a maximum of 10 passages,REFRAGmatches LLaMA’s performance while achieving a5.26×\nspeedup in TTFT. At equal latency (8 passages forREFRAGvs. 1 for LLaMA),REFRAGattains a1.22%\naverage improvement across 16 RAG tasks. With a weak retriever setting, at 10 passages,REFRAGimproves\nperformance by0.71%and accelerates TTFT by5.26× compared to LLaMA. At equal latency (8 passages for\nREFRAGvs. 1 for LLaMA),REFRAGachieves a1.93%average gain over 16 RAG tasks. 5.2 Multi-Turn Conversation\nWe use three different knowledge-intensive multi-turn conversation datasets: TopiOCQA (Adlakha et al.,\n2022), ORConvQA (Qu et al., 2020), and QReCC (Anantha et al., 2021). For each conversation turn, we\nretrieveKpassages using the same retriever and retrieval corpus as described in section 5.1. Result analysis.Table 4 presents results across varying numbers of conversational turns and retrieved passages. Our model outperformsLLaMAFT on two out of three datasets in the 5-passage setting, and on all three\ndatasets in the 10-passage setting. This improvement is attributable to the limited 4k-token context window of\nLLaMAFT, which necessitates truncating portions of the conversational history in longer contexts, resulting\nin the loss of crucial information required to answer subsequent questions. In contrast, our model, trained on\nthe sameLLaMA model without extending its effective positional encoding, maintains robust performance\n3Note that the implementation of our exact match is stricter than other works. We follow the work of Lin et al.'), Document(metadata={'page': 9, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='(2024)\nand Lin et al. (2024) focused on fine-tuning existing LLMs by prepending retrieved passages to prompts and\nemploying ensemble methods for response generation. Additionally, Izacard and Grave (2021) introduced\nfusion-in-decoder, which uses an encoder to process each passage in parallel and concatenates the hidden states\nfor generation via a decoder. This approach accelerates attention computation by removing cross-document\nattention, but does not apply compression in the decoder, which could further reduce latency. Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements. Complementary approaches\nrank or prune context by estimated informativeness, e.g.,Selective Contextuses self-information to drop\nlow-value tokens, and sentence-level methods learn context-aware encoders for question-specific compression\nand faster inference Li et al.

The flop rate of the GPU is\nf, and the high bandwidth memory of the GPU ism and we use the compression rate ofk in our encoder. We assume that all our chunk embeddings are precomputed and cached. The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time. Overall we achieve upto6.78× and\n6.06×acceleration in throughput much higher than CEPE in the long context scenario.

For instance, in multi-turn conversations (Roller et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), incorporating historical\ndialogue into the context enables LLMs to respond more effectively to user queries. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources. These examples highlight the power of LLMs to learn\nfrom context. However, it is well established that increasing prompt length for contextual learning leads\nto higher latency and greater memory consumption during inference (Yen et al., 2024). Specifically, longer\nprompts require additional memory for the key-value (KV) cache, which scales linearly with prompt length. Moreover, the time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency increases quadratically, while the time-to-iterative-token\n(TTIT) latency grows linearly with prompt length (Liu et al., 2025). As a result, LLM inference throughput\ndegrades with larger contexts, limiting their applicability in scenarios demanding high throughput and low\nlatency, such as web-scale discovery. Therefore, developing novel model architectures that optimize memory\nusage and inference latency is crucial for enhancing the practicality of contextual learning in these applications. Optimizing inference latency for LLMs with extensive context is an active area of research, with approaches\n1\narXiv:2509.01092v2  [cs.CL]  12 Oct 2025'), Document(metadata={'page': 14, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='Howard Yen, Tianyu Gao, and Danqi Chen.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

However, most existing methods target generic LLM tasks with long context and are largely\northogonal to our work. This paper focuses on RAG-based applications, such as web-scale search, with the\ngoal of improving inference latency, specifically, the TTFT. We argue that specialized techniques exploiting the\nunique structure and sparsity inherent in RAG contexts can substantially reduce memory and computational\noverhead. Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and\nother correlations with the query are already available due to the use of vectorizations and re-rankings. This\ninformation is discarded during decoding. 3)Unusually Structured and Sparse Attention.Due to diversity\nand other operations such as deduplication, most context chunks during decoding are unrelated, resulting in\npredominantly zero cross-attention between chunks (see figure 7). 1.1 Our Contributions\nWe proposeREFRAG(REpresentation For RAG), a novel mechanism for efficient decoding of contexts\nin RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters. REFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder. This approach offers three main advantages: 1) It\nshortens the decoder’s input length, improving token allocation efficiency; 2) It enables reuse of pre-computed\nchunk embeddings from retrieval, eliminating redundant computation; and 3) It reduces attention computation\ncomplexity, which now scales quadratically with the number of chunks rather than the number of tokens in\nthe context. Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings. We provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization. Results show that we achieve30.75× TTFT acceleration without loss in perplexity\nwhich is3 .75× than previous method. Moreover, with extended context due to our compression,REFRAG\nachieves better performance than LLaMA without incurring higher latency in the downstream applications. 2 Model Architecture\nWe denote the decoder model asMdec and the encoder model asMenc. Given an input withT tokens\nx1, x2, . . . , xT , we assume that the firstq tokens are main input tokens (e.g., questions) and the lasts tokens\nare context tokens (e.g., retrieved passages in RAG). We haveq + s = T. For clarity, we focus on a single\nturn of question and retrieval in this section. Model overview.Figure 1 shows the main architecture ofREFRAG.

(2024) to use the next paragraph prediction\ntasks for continual pre-training (CPT). Specifically, for each data data point, it containss + o = T number\nof tokens, which we use for CPT to prepare the model for downstream tasks utilizing chunk embeddings. To further enhance performance, we introduce selective compression via RL. After aligning the encoder and\ndecoder through CPT, we apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt the model to specific downstream\ntasks, such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Additional details are provided in section 5. During CPT, we input the firsts tokens x1:s into the encoder and use its output to assist the decoder in\npredicting the nexto tokens xs+1:s+o. This task encourages the model to leverage contextual information for\nnext-paragraph prediction, thereby equipping it for downstream applications.

Efficient Long-Context LLMs.Recent research has investigated various strategies to reduce memory usage\nand accelerate latency in long-context generation for LLMs. Choromanski et al. (2021) introduced compressed\nattention, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear; however, this method does not address\nmemory requirements. It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency. StreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al. (2025) proposed PCC, an embedding-based memory mechanism that summarizes past\ncontext into compact vectors, enabling retrieval of salient information during subsequent processing. Like\nCEPE, PCC is limited to prefix context applications and does not support arbitrary folding or expansion of\ncontexts at any position. Interestingly, Kuratov et al. (2025) investigated the capacity of LLMs to encode\nlong contexts into a single embedding, demonstrating minimal information loss for sequences up to 1500\ntokens. Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture. Compressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications. However, this approach only\ndecreases KV cache memory usage, does not improve time-to-first-token latency, and requires training the\nmodel from scratch. Yoshida et al. (2021) extended this idea by employing recursive context compression,\ngenerating a summary hidden state for each chunk to inform the next chunk’s computation. The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation. Furthermore, our\nmethod learns where to apply compression, allowing for adaptive compression rates at inference time without\nrecomputing chunk embeddings. Prompt compression.Prompt compression seeks to reduce input token length to lower latency and cost\nwhile maintaining task performance. A prominent approach isLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2023),which employs\ncoarse-to-fine, budget-controlled compression with token-level iterative refinement, achieving high compression\nratios with minimal performance loss.LongLLMLingua(Jiang et al., 2024) extends this method to long-context\nscenarios, demonstrating significant cost and end-to-end speed improvements.

The perplexity-based selection is an heuristic based selection which compresses\nchunks with low perplexity (Perplexity-desc) or high perplexity (Perplexity-asc).

C.1 Additional Contextual Application - Summarization Task\nWe fine-tune our model on the long document summarization dataset (Cohan et al., 2018). This dataset\ncontains long scientific articles from Arxiv and Pubmed, and the task is to generate the abstract given the\nentire article. This application is challenging due to the long-context nature of the task. We fine-tune the\nREFRAGandLLaMAmodels on these two datasets and report the performance on the validation set. The\nsummarization task provides an ideal condition to inspect whether it is beneficial to bring more information\nwith compressed representation or less information without compression, since correct summarization requires\ncomplete information from the whole document.

Our model\nachieves the best performance under the same number of decoder tokens (i.e., same latency).

This finding is particularly surprising, asREFRAG16 achieves a compression rate of8without recomputing\nchunk embeddings, yet still surpasses the performance ofREFRAG8. These results further highlight the\neffectiveness of the RL-trained policy and underscore the practicality of dynamically adjusting the compression\nrate without compromising performance. REFRAG trained under different compression rates.Figure 10 illustrates the training trajectory ofREFRAG\nunder different compression rates in the continual pre-training task. We observe a performance regression as\nthe compression rate increases; however, even at a compression rate of32, our model remains competitive\n(as shown in table 1). In contrast, a compression rate of64appears to be overly aggressive, resulting in\ndiminished performance. These findings suggest a practical limit to the compression rate beyond which the\nmodel’s capability is significantly reduced.

Figure 11 presents results for various encoder-decoder\ncombinations. We observe that increasing the number of parameters in the decoder leads to a substantial\nreduction in loss, whereas enlarging the encoder yields only a modest improvement. This discrepancy may\nbe attributed to the relatively minor increase in size from RoBERTa-Base to RoBERTa-Large compared to\nthe substantial jump from 7B to 13B in the decoder.

The flop rate of the GPU is\nf, and the high bandwidth memory of the GPU ism and we use the compression rate ofk in our encoder. We assume that all our chunk embeddings are precomputed and cached. The model is loaded with bfloat16\nprecision. We focus our analysis on LLaMA-2-7B model. The results should be generalizable to other models. We use the following metrics: TTFT which is the latency for the system to generate the first token; TTIT\nwhich is the time that it takes to generate iterative token after the first token; Throughput which is the\nnumber of tokens that are generated from the system in a unit time. Table 6 shows that with short context\nlength s we are able to achievek× acceleration in TTFT and up tok× acceleration in throughput. With\nlonger context lengths, we are able to achieve up tok2× acceleration in both TTFT and throughput. The\ndetails on the latency and throughput calculation are in section B.4. Empirical verification of latency/throughput improvement.Figure 2 shows the empirical measurement of\nthe acceleration ofREFRAGcompared with CEPE, a previous work that achieves significant acceleration\nin inference (Yen et al., 2024). Under the context length of16384(i.e., mid-to-long context),REFRAG\nachieves16 .53× acceleration in TTFT with cache and8.59× without cache. Both higher than CEPE (i.e.,\n2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1). With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time. Overall we achieve upto6.78× and\n6.06×acceleration in throughput much higher than CEPE in the long context scenario.
