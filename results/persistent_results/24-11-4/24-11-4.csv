Extensive experiments across a range of long-context applications,\nincluding RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, demonstrate thatREFRAG\nachieves up to30.85× TTFT acceleration (3.75× over previous state-of-the-art methods) without any loss in\nperplexity or downstream accuracy. Our results highlight the importance of specialized treatment for RAG-\nbased systems and open new directions for efficient large-context LLM inference.

Less critical segments are compressed, while essential\nones remain intact, as illustrated in figure 5. We employ RL to train a policy that optimally determines which\nsegments to compress.\nTo enable selective compression, we continue pretraining the encoder and decoder to process a combination\nof token and chunk embeddings.

Extensive experiments across a range of long-context applications,\nincluding RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, demonstrate thatREFRAG\nachieves up to30.85× TTFT acceleration (3.75× over previous state-of-the-art methods) without any loss in\nperplexity or downstream accuracy. Our results highlight the importance of specialized treatment for RAG-\nbased systems and open new directions for efficient large-context LLM inference.

In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022), LLMs generate more accurate answers by utilizing\nrelevant search results retrieved from external sources.
