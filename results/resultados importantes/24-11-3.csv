Treating RAG TTFT as a generic LLM inference problem overlooks several key aspects: 1)\nInefficient Token Allocation.RAG contexts often contain sparse information, with many retrieved passages\nbeing uninformative and reused across multiple inferences. Allocating memory/computation for all the\ntokens, as we show in this paper, is unnecessarily wasteful. 2)Wasteful Encoding and Other Information.The\nretrieval process in RAG has already pre-processed the chunks of the contexts, and their encodings and'), Document(metadata={'page': 1, 'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf'}, page_content='in RAG.REFRAGsignificantly reduces latency, TTFT, and memory usage during decoding, allwithout\nrequiring modificationsto the LLM architecture or introducing new decoder parameters.\nREFRAGmakes several novel modifications to the decoding process: Instead of using tokens from retrieved\npassages as input,REFRAGleverages pre-computed, compressed chunk embeddings as approximate represen-\ntations, feeding these embeddings directly into the decoder.

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system\nlatency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput\nand a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing\nlatency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG systems\nrequire specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated\npassages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages\noften exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to\nblock-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks.

The baseline ofREFRAG8 will\nhave the same latency as theLLaMAFT model. However, due to the compression, we are able to have more\ncontext information and hence achieve better performance. Surprisingly,REFRAG16 and REFRAG32 both\noutperform theLLaMAFT model despite having2× and4 × fewer tokens in the decoder (i.e., lower latency).\nThe same result occurs in long context scenarios.

Ideally, this approach should outperform random\nselection, which is indeed observed in figure 3. The RL-based selective compression policy consistently achieves\nsuperior performance across varying compression ratesp.\n4.1 Ablation Study\nCurriculum learning is essential for effective training in the reconstruction task.The reconstruction task, while\nintuitive, is particularly challenging when multiple chunks must be reconstructed.

The recursive\nnature, however, prevents pre-computation and reuse of chunk embeddings, and does not reduce decoding\nlatency. Chevalier et al. (2023) proposed recursive compression for documents, using compressed embeddings\nfor prediction, similar to our method. However, their sequential compression process results in high latency\nwhen the summary vector is not cached, and their approach only supports applications where the summary\ntoken is restricted to the prefix of the language model (e.g., RAG), limiting applicability. In contrast, our\nwork is the first to enable pre-computation of chunk embeddings and their use at arbitrary positions within\nthe prompt, supporting diverse applications such as RAG and multi-turn conversation.

It is complementary to our approach and can be integrated to further improve latency.\nStreamingLLM(Xiao et al., 2024) proposed attention sinks to decrease KV cache memory for long-context\ngeneration, though this does not reduce latency during the pre-filling stage. CEPE (Yen et al., 2024) employs\ncross-attention to token embeddings from context tokens, reducing both KV cache memory and attention\ncomputations. However, CEPE is limited to prefix context applications, as it disrupts the causal structure of\nthe context, making it unsuitable for tasks such as multi-turn RAG or summarization. Additionally, CEPE\ndoes not utilize token compression, resulting in similar or even increased decoding latency. Concurrently with\nour work, Dai et al.

With longer\ncontext, we are able to achieve up to32.99× acceleration in TTFT. The reason why we get such acceleration\neven without cache is that the encoder is light-weight (e.g., Roberta-large is 355M-sized) and the chunks\nare processed parallel without attending to each other. In terms of TTIT, we achieve3× acceleration in\nlong context scenario in both cached and not cached scenarios. This is expected since they have the same\nnumber of KV caches to attend to. However, CEPE is worse than original LLaMA in TTIT since it require\nthe additional computation of KV cache projection in the inference time.

Unlike prior methods (Yen et al., 2024),REFRAGsupports compression of token chunks at\narbitrary positions (see figure 1) while preserving the autoregressive nature of the decoder, thereby supporting\nmulti-turn and agentic applications. This “compress anywhere” capability is further enhanced by a lightweight\nreinforcement learning (RL) policy that selectively determines when full chunk token input is necessary\nand when low-cost, approximate chunk embeddings suffice . As a result,REFRAGminimizes reliance on\ncomputationally intensive token embeddings, condensing most chunks for the query in RAG settings.\nWe provide rigorous experimental validations of the effectiveness ofREFRAGin continual pre-training\nand many real word long-context applications including RAG, multi-turn conversation with RAG and long\ndocument summarization.

Curriculum learning incrementally increases task difficulty, enabling the\nmodel to gradually and effectively acquire complex skills. For the reconstruction task, training begins with\nreconstructing a single chunk: the encoder receives one chunk embeddingc1 for x1:k and and the decoder\nreconstructs thek tokens using the projected chunk embeddingecnk\n1 . Subsequently, the model reconstructs\nx1:2k frome cnk\n1 , ecnk\n2 , and so forth. To continuously adjust task difficulty, we vary the data mixture over\ntime, starting with examples dominated by easier tasks (e.g., single chunk embedding) and gradually shifting')]"

Their work examines the extent to which information can be compressed into a single embedding,\noffering a complementary perspective to REFRAG, which is designed for decoding from multiple compact\nembeddings within the standard decoder architecture.\nCompressive transformer.Rae et al. (2020) first introduced the compressive transformer, which compresses\nthe KV cache to reduce memory requirements for long-context applications.

We employ RL to train a policy that optimally determines which\nsegments to compress.\nTo enable selective compression, we continue pretraining the encoder and decoder to process a combination\nof token and chunk embeddings. Given a context ofs tokens x1, . . . , xs, chunked intoL fixed-length chunks\nC1, . . . , CL, we achieve a compression fraction of1−p by randomly selectingT′ := pL chunks to remain\nuncompressed for the decoder.

These studies show that such greedy\nformulations enable the use of RL to achieve near-optimal solutions and generalize well across diverse settings.\nMotivated by these findings, we adopt a sequential formulation for selective compression and employ RL to\ntrain an effective policy (see section 2).\nWe learn a policy networkπθ that takes chunk embeddings{ci}L\ni=1 and sequentially selectsT′ chunk indices'), Document(metadata={'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='KV cache memory ks+ko\ns+ko 1∼k×k×\nTTFT k2(6ds+s2)\n6dsk+s2 k×k 2×\nTTIT 2dlbsk+nk+2dlbok\n2dlbs+nk+2dlbok 1×k×\nThroughput k∗TTFT+k∗TTIT\nTTFT+kTTIT ∼ k2∗TTFT+k2∗TTIT\nTTFT+k∗TTIT 1∼k×k∼k 2×\nTable 6The acceleration in latency/save in memory ofREFRAGcompared to the original LLaMA model.\nA.1 Modeling REFRAG Selective Compression\nIn this section, we introduce selective token compression, based on the hypothesis that different context\nsegments contribute unequally to answer prediction. Less critical segments are compressed, while essential\nones remain intact, as illustrated in figure 5. We employ RL to train a policy that optimally determines which\nsegments to compress.\nTo enable selective compression, we continue pretraining the encoder and decoder to process a combination\nof token and chunk embeddings. Given a context ofs tokens x1, . . . , xs, chunked intoL fixed-length chunks\nC1, . . . , CL, we achieve a compression fraction of1−p by randomly selectingT′ := pL chunks to remain\nuncompressed for the decoder. This pretraining allows the model to effectively handle mixed inputs at\narbitrary positions, which is essential for the subsequent RL policy learning.'), Document(metadata={'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='Motivated by these findings, we adopt a sequential formulation for selective compression and employ RL to\ntrain an effective policy (see section 2).\nWe learn a policy networkπθ that takes chunk embeddings{ci}L\ni=1 and sequentially selectsT′ chunk indices\nl1, . . . , lT′, wherel t ∈[L].

Additional details are provided in section 5.\nDuring CPT, we input the firsts tokens x1:s into the encoder and use its output to assist the decoder in\npredicting the nexto tokens xs+1:s+o. This task encourages the model to leverage contextual information for\nnext-paragraph prediction, thereby equipping it for downstream applications.

Extensive experiments across a range of long-context applications,\nincluding RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, demonstrate thatREFRAG\nachieves up to30.85× TTFT acceleration (3.75× over previous state-of-the-art methods) without any loss in\nperplexity or downstream accuracy. Our results highlight the importance of specialized treatment for RAG-\nbased systems and open new directions for efficient large-context LLM inference. We believe thatREFRAG\nprovides a practical and scalable solution for deploying LLMs in latency-sensitive, knowledge-intensive\napplications.\n8 Acknowledgements\nWe thank for Jason Chen, Yao Liu, Norman Huang, Xueyuan Su, Pranesh Srinivasan, Avinash Atreya, Riham\nMansour, Jeremy Teboul for insightful discussions and support.\n11'), Document(metadata={'source': './data/paper_refrag.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='2.01× and1 .04× acceleration respectively) while having better model performance (see table 1).

These passages\noften exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to\nblock-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based\non this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are\nunnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose\nREFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency\nin RAG applications.
